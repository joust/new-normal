<p>
This browser app is a playground build around a huge collection of arguments used during (Corona related) discussions. The imaginary two sides are (technically) referred to as <b>Idiots</b> and <b>Sheep</b>. The two usages currently implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>A <b>Corona Test</b>, which allows you to find out which "side" you are on. Choose your "cycles" and after that number of decisions on contradicting arguments you know if you're an <b>Idiot</b> or a <b>Sheep</b>.</li>
  <li>A <b>Buzzword BINGO game</b>, played with arguments used in a discussion. Use it to have more fun in either your own discussions on the topic or that of others.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Technically its a plain HTML/CSS/ES6 PWA app. The app is inter&shy;nationa&shy;lized and localized and contains a common core of universal, language inde&shy;pen&shy;dent argu&shy;ments and sets of argu&shy;ments only used and under&shy;stood locally.
</p>
<h1>Content</h1>
<h2>Menus and Arguments</h2>
<p>
All internationalized application content is stored in HTML format in language-directories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/intro.html</code>: the application intro</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/start.html</code>: main application menu</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/gameplay.html</code>: gameplay instructions</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/install.html</code>: PWA installation instructions</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/support.html</code>: Support instructions</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/test.html</code>: the test categories and questions</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/result.html</code>: the test result template</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/credits.html</code>: the credits</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/attitude.html</code>: the attitude (see next chapter)</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/legal.html</code>: the legal notice</li>
</ul>
<p>
All internationalized argu&shy;ments are stored in HTML format in language- and terri&shy;tory-direc&shy;tories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/sheep.html</code>: Common core <b>Idiot</b> argu&shy;ments and labels</li>
<li><code>&lt;language code&gt;/idiot.html</code>: Common core <b>Sheep</b> argu&shy;ments and labels</li>
<li><code>&lt;territory code&gt;/sheep-local.html</code>: Local <b>Sheep</b> argu&shy;ments</li>
<li><code>&lt;territory code&gt;/idiot-local.html</code>: Local <b>Idiot</b> argu&shy;ments</li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments of the Common core have a unique id across all languagues:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>I&lt;n&gt;</code> for the <b>Idiot</b> arguments</li>
<li><code>S&lt;n&gt;</code> for the <b>Sheep</b> arguments</li>
</ul>
<p>The local arguments have a unique id with the territory code in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>I&lt;territory code&gt;&lt;n&gt;</code> for the <b>Idiot</b> arguments</li>
<li><code>S&lt;territory code&gt;&lt;n&gt;</code> for the <b>Sheep</b> arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>All pejorative / judgmental wording in the arguments should be set in italics so it can be removed according to the users attitude (see chapter Attitude). Example:</p>
<code>
  &lt;p&gt;They say&lt;i&gt; in all seriousness&lt;/i&gt; that ...&lt;/p&gt;
</code>

<h2>Sources and Counter Arguments</h2>
<p>
The Sources for all Arguments are stored language-mixed in the top-level file <code>sources.html</code>, together with the cross references to counter arguments.  
</p>
<p>A source is represented by an anchor with language, reference to the argument, the link url and the link text as text:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a lang="en" class="I99" href="https://...."&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A reference to a counter argument is represented by a quote with reference to the argument, containing the id of the counter argument as text:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;q class="counter I99"&gt;S77&lt;/q&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<h1>Technical</h1>

<h2>Modern Browsers</h2>

<p>The app will only work on modern browsers as it relies on things like css animations, fetch and native es6 features like async/await, arrow functions, template strings and deconstruction. When Service Workers are available, it will also offline its content.</p>

<h2>FastClick</h2>

<p>FastClick is (still) included to supress click delays on mobile platforms. I am aware that it is long deprecated &amp; unsupported and that there are viewport settings and platform specific css <code>touch-action: manipulation</code> to fix most issues in modern OS versions.</p>

<h1>Attitude</h1>

<p>The App allows to configure your attitude. It will be stored in the local storage of your browser:</p>

<h2>hasty</h2>
<p>Skip the intro sequence.</p>

<h2>curious</h2>
<p>Auto-Flip to the details for selected arguments.</p>
 
<h2>open</h2>
<p>Show the sources to the arguments immediately.</p>

<h2>fair</h2>
<p>Do not randomly choose from pejorative labels for card titles.</p>

<h2>correct</h2>
<p>Follow the label with a gender identity rights conformant extension.</p>

<h2>friendly</h2>
<p>Remove all pejorative argument wording (the text blocks set in italics).</p>

<h1>Exclusion of Arguments</h1>
<p>
The app allows to exclude arguments from being used in the generation of game cards. This helps to deprecate old arguments that are not common in discussions any more - or simply to exclude arguments that you do not expect getting used.</p>
<p>
In front of every argument title in the list you find a checkbox to toggle it's exclusion. If its grey, an arguments will not be used during the next card generation. Your choice will be stored in the local storage of your browser.
</p>

<h1>Permalinks</h1>
<p>The app allows to deep link directy to arguments, e.g. to transmit them to others. This can be achieved just by specifying the argument ids in the url's hash. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#I17</code>: Show <b>idiot</b> argument with id <code>I17</code></li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#S69</code>: Show <b>sheep</b> argument with id <code>S69</code></li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#I17&amp;S69</code>: Show both arguments with id <code>I17</code> and <code>S69</code></li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#I</code>: Show all <b>idiot</b> arguments</li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#S</code>: Show all <b>sheep</b> arguments</li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#S&amp;I</code>: Show all arguments of both sides, first the <b>sheep</b></li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#I&amp;S</code>: Show all arguments of both sides, first the <b>idiots</b></li>
<li><code>https://new-normal.app#T17</code>: Show both the <b>idiot</b> and the <b>sheep</b> argument belonging to corona test topic <code>T17</code></li>
</ul>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>
The following is in development or planned:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more <a href="https://github.com/joust/new-normal/blob/master/sources.html">sources</a> to all arguments for anyone to check</li>
<li>Extend the number of available localizations by translating the common core and gather the local arguments used</li>
</ul>
<h1>Support</h1>
<p>
Aside from making sound fun of the either/or division that many people think is real these days, this little app has big things in store: It wants to build bridges, create awareness and knowledge. It is for people who really want to deal with the arguments of the other side of the discourse. It wants to make sure that people approach each other again. It wants to be a valuable source and enable an open and well-founded exchange.
</p><p>
The contents of this app - like our reality - are in con&shy;stant flux. New argu&shy;ments are added regu&shy;larly and others become irrele&shy;vant. In addition, there are argu&shy;ments that are used worldwide (the common core) and argu&shy;ments only used and under&shy;stood locally. For keeping this up to date, your support is very welcome!
