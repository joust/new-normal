<h1>Corona Bingo</h1>

<h2>Aim of the Game</h2>
<p>
Similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword_bingo">Buzzword Bingo</a>, you try to be the first player to get a row, column or diagonal together on a BINGO card. 
Instead of buzzwords you collect <b>arguments</b> used in a real discussion between <b>idiots</b> and <b>sheep</b>!
</p>
<h2>Variations and Gameplay</h2>
<p>
Precondition for playing is a <b>real</b> discussion about the Corona topic. All participants record arguments used <b>by the other side</b> on their cards - until the first has a 5-in-a-row and calls "BINGO!" ðŸ˜‰
</p>
<h3>1. Discussant</h3>
<p>
You are a <b>discussant</b> in the discussion. You're on one of the sides - <b>idiots</b> or <b>sheeple</b> - and use the App to generate one or two cards from the other side. On them you can tick off arguments brought forward by the others in the discussion. 
</p>
<h3>2. Listener</h3>
<p>
You are merely a <b>listener</b> to the discussion. You look at the discussants and choose either one or two cards from one side or the other. In the simplest setting one card for each side. Then you follow the discussion attentively and record arguments that are brought in by both sides.
</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Exclusion of Topics</h3>
<p>
The app allows to exclude topics from being used in the generation of game cards. This helps to deprecate old topics/arguments that are not common in discussions any more - or simply to exclude topics that you do not expect getting used.
</p><p>
In front of every topic title in the list you find a checkbox to toggle it's exclusion. If its checked, it will be used during the next card generation, otherwise not. Your choice will be stored in the local storage of your browser.
</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
While with Buzzword- and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)">Original Bingo</a>, you fully depend on chance, in <b>New Normal</b>, the ongoing, real discussion, in which you may take part yourself, provides a wide range of opportunities to influence your own chances. 
</p><p>
The strategic component in variant 1 is that by influencing the discussion, you can get your counterpart to put forward arguments that you still need for your BINGO! 
</p><p>  
To do this though, you usually have to put forward own arguments that can give the other side an advantage. Therefore, you should always pay attention which player tries to lead the discussion to which topic area. 
</p><p>
Should the discussion in variant 2 stall, as a <b>listener</b> you can draw up to three <b>jokers</b>. A <b>joker</b> allows you to whisper something to one of the discussants to animate or steer the discussion.</p>
