<h1>The<i> Idiots</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="I1" spellcheck><h2>Immune system?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our immune system protects us against viruses. And that, if we didn't have one, the good Lord would let us be born with an everyday mask.</span></p></a>
<a id="I2" spellcheck><h2>PCR test not validated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all PCR test products used are not validated and therefore not approved for diagnostic / clinical use. And that this is even stated on the package inserts.</span></p></a>
<a id="I3" spellcheck><h2>PCR test only with symptoms</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>if at all, that PCR tests should only be used to find out whether the virus is involved in the disease (with symptoms). In healthy people the error rate should be much too high!</span></p></a>
<a id="I4" spellcheck><h2>100 different PCR tests</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are hundreds of PCR test products from different manufacturers, all of which work differently and give different results. And that you can always get the result you need!</span></p></a>
<a id="I5" spellcheck><h2>Fundamental rights</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the fundamental rights are called so because they cannot be overridden. And that all the decrees by which this is currently done are void and will not stand up in court.</span></p></a>
<a id="I6" spellcheck><h2>Like in the 1930s</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our society is slipping into totalitarianism, just like germany did in the 1930s. And that we &lsquo;sheeple&rsquo; let this happen to us just like our &lsquo;great-grandsheeple&rsquo; did back then.</span></p></a>
<a id="I7" spellcheck><h2>Disinfectants useless</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that most disinfectants are only effective against bacteria, but not against viruses (virucidity). And that they have no effect at all if the exposure time is not sufficient.</span></p></a>
<a id="I8" spellcheck><h2>Masks of no use</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that almost all available scientific studies question the effectiveness of masks. And that Drosten himself has even admitted this several times.</span></p></a>
<a id="I9" spellcheck><h2>Mask harmful</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that wearing masks for longer periods of time leads to an oxygen deficiency which is harmful to the human body. And that this results in permanent damage like the death of brain cells!</span></p></a>
<a id="I10" spellcheck><h2>Illness- and suicide-rates</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that measures with economic effects, especially lockdowns, drive people into distress, into virus and existential fear and into loneliness. And that the rates of illness and suicide multiply.</span></p></a>
<a id="I11" spellcheck><h2>Measures worldwide fatal</h2>
<p>They<i> say in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the measures to contain the virus are claiming many more victims worldwide than the virus itself. And that billions of people worldwide are threatened with the loss of their livelihoods!</span></p></a>
<a id="I12" spellcheck><h2>Depopulation plans</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span> that the ongoing economic lockdowns are fatally wrong and leading to hunger and death of hundreds of millions of people. And that this fits in with the plans of elitist circles to drastically reduce the world population - for the good of us all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I13" spellcheck><h2>Printing money dangerous</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a lot of money will be printed for all those who now have to be supported due to the measures. And that this makes the economic future unpredictable.</span></p></a>
<a id="I14" spellcheck><h2>Great Reset</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corona crisis is the vehicle for a hard restart of globalized capitalism, according to the official Great Reset plan of the World Economic Forum (WEF). And that this has even been addressed by Grover in the Sesame Street.</span></p></a>
<a id="I15" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates no physician</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Bill Gates, as a software developer and big pharma lobbyist, was not voted by anyone to decide on the medical fate of all of mankind. And that he, with his corrupt practices, only changed from the software business to another.</span></p></a>
<a id="I16" spellcheck><h2>Children suffer</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that children are frightened, traumatized and their development is massively impaired by the current measures in daycare centers and schools. And that this is completely disproportionate.</span></p></a>
<a id="I17" spellcheck><h2>Look to Australia</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in the Australian state of Victoria, local politics has combined a drastic lockdown with curfews and full surveillance of the population. And that not even demonstrating was legally possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I18" spellcheck><h2>Parliamentary reservation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all decisions which are of substantial weight for the community must be decided in the parliament. And that this should apply in particular to Corona measures and regulations.</span></p></a>
<a id="I19" spellcheck><h2>Threat of fascism</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that one can observe a world-wide seizure of power by the executive. And that therefore, with the words of Adorno, one fears the return of fascism in the guise of democracy!</span></p></a>
<a id="I20" spellcheck><h2>Socialism remake</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the arbitrary nature of the state's measures and the lack of explanations for their plausibility seem like a new edition of earlier real-socialist regimes. And that the coercive enforcement by an over-present and encroaching executive also fits in with this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I21" spellcheck><h2>Scientific discourse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are also innumerable scientists, who rate the usefulness of the measures and the risk posed by the virus completely different. And that they must be included in the public discourse.</span></p></a>
<a id="I22" spellcheck><h2>Positive test not disease</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a positive PCR test detects neither infection nor disease, as only symptoms allow such a diagnosis. And that therefore the use of these terms in the media is completely wrong and misleading.</span></p></a>
<a id="I23" spellcheck><h2>Viruses do not exist</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a valid scientific position is that there are no viruses. And that the effects ascribed to them actually result from the body's own exosomes!</span></p></a>
<a id="I24" spellcheck><h2>Flatten the Curve?!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that we have long since stopped using the occupancy rate of our hospitals as a measure and instead are using arbitrary numbers like positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants. And that these figures no longer allow any statements about real risks.</span></p></a>
<a id="I25" spellcheck><h2>Not without us!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in hardly transparent and unelected structures it was and is decided how the whole world should be &lsquo;re-started&rsquo;. And that the ones who have to cope with the results would have to be included in the decisions.</span></p></a>
<a id="I26" spellcheck><h2>infection fatality rate 0.x%</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, according to many studies, the infectious mortality rate IFR is about as high for the novel virus as for the influenza virus. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="I27" spellcheck><h2>Mild Flu</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the new virus is about as dangerous as a medium flu. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk to the vast majority of the population.</span></p></a>
<a id="I28" spellcheck><h2>PCR-Tests Big business</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that PCR tests are a billion-dollar business for many pharmaceutical companies. And that these profits are out of all proportion compared to the benefits for the general public.</span></p></a>
<a id="I29" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines Big business</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccines are a relatively low-risk billion-dollar business for pharmaceutical companies. And that Bill Gates himself has have estimated the return on investment (ROI) at 2200%.</span></p></a>
<a id="I30" spellcheck><h2>Censorship</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that information contradicting the official narrative regarding the virus exists, but is censored in the media. And that this gives the population a false impression.</span></p></a>
<a id="I31" spellcheck><h2>Manipulation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a lot of the information that is communicated in the official Corona story is manipulated. And that those who fall for it, get misleaded by handling information uncritically.</span></p></a>
<a id="I32" spellcheck><h2>Media spreads fear</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our mass media currently tends to stir up disproportionate fears in the population. And that these fears lead to a strong increase of anxiety disorders and suicides!</span></p></a>
<a id="I33" spellcheck><h2>No excess mortality</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is no excess mortality at all on an annual average worldwide. And that this means that the risk of death has not changed compared to previous years.</span></p></a>
<a id="I34" spellcheck><h2>No Flu any more</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since corona victim numbers are presented, statistically hardly any influenza victims are recorded. And that this indicates that there is simply a statistical reinterpretation of these victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="I35" spellcheck><h2>Age mortality</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the average age at which virus victims die worldwide is the same as the normal mortality rate in their respective countries. And that usually a positive test, sometimes not even that is enough for getting counted as a Corona death.</span></p></a>
<a id="I36" spellcheck><h2>Swine flu</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that everything we are experiencing right now has already happened like this before 10 years ago with the swine flu, even with the same actors! And at that time was exposed as an expensive lobby operation of the pharmaceutical industry.</span></p></a>
<a id="I37" spellcheck><h2>Knows no one</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>just because they do not know anybody in their circle of acquaintances who is seriously ill or has died from the virus, it cannot be the &lsquo;killer virus&rsquo; it is thought to be.</span></p></a>
<a id="I38" spellcheck><h2>Sweden successful</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span> that Sweden, despite having only made recommendations to its citizens, is now doing better than the rest of the world. And that this would be a clear indication that the measures imposed elsewhere have not brought any improvement.</span></p></a>
<a id="I39" spellcheck><h2>Great Barrington Declaration</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are tens of thousands of scientists and physicians who ask for completely different measures, but they are not heard. And that their position can be read in the &lsquo;Great Barrington Declaration&rsquo;.</span></p></a>
<a id="I40" spellcheck><h2>Central Bank Digital Currency</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that while we all are busy with the virus, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is being realized in the background, soon used by all of us. And that the possibility to pay anonymously will quickly disappear!</span></p></a>
<a id="I41" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic criteria lowered</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the WHO criteria for a pandemic were lowered during the swine flu crisis, which was demonstrably staged by the pharmaceutical industry in 2009 to boost its vaccine sales. And that this circumstance has only made the current pandemic possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I42" spellcheck><h2>WHO = Big Pharma</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the World Health Organization (WHO) is not an independent institution that takes care of all of us. And that it is financed and controlled by pharmaceutical companies for profit.</span></p></a>
<a id="I43" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates controls ...</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>Bill Gates and his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the trust of the same name would make profits for pharmaceutical companies under the guise of philanthropy. And that is one of the drivers for the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I44" spellcheck><h2>Wrong intensive treatment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the treatment of many patients seriously ill with the virus with ventilators would be wrong and would even increase mortality. And that just the simple treatment with oxygen would be demonstrably more successful.</span></p></a>
<a id="I45" spellcheck><h2>Autopsies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that without an autopsy it is usually impossible to determine which of the hundreds of respiratory viruses or other diseases a patient died of. And that in many countries the positive test alone is the basis for the declaration of COVID death.</span></p></a>
<a id="I46" spellcheck><h2>WITH not BY the virus</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is not at all clear how many of the virus victims died FROM and how many died only WITH the virus. And that this cannot even be determined by testing for a single virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="I47" spellcheck><h2>No asymptomatic transmission</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that according to studies, transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers is practically non-existent. And that the measures decreed wordwide onto healthy people are therefore superfluous.</span></p></a>
<a id="I48" spellcheck><h2>PLANdemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the pandemic must actually be called a PLANdemic, because it was obviously prepared for a long time. And that there is uncountable, well-documented evidence of this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I49" spellcheck><h2>Event 201</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the pandemic exercise &lsquo;Event 201&rsquo; from October 2019, shortly before the outbreak of the real pandemic in China, is a central indication that we are dealing with a planned event.</span></p></a>
<a id="I50" spellcheck><h2>Intensive beds normal</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that an increasing number of occupied intensive care beds is normal during the cold season and happens every year. And that the figures are deliberately not presented in the context of previous years.</span></p></a>
<a id="I51" spellcheck><h2>Test pandemic only</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the so called &lsquo;second wave&rsquo; is mainly a &lsquo;test pandemic&rsquo; because neither the occupancy of intensive care beds nor the number of deaths follows the steep rise in positive test results. And that in many countries these values are even going into the other direction.</span></p></a>
<a id="I52" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns kill!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that excess mortality peaks worldwide are caused by the imposition of measures such as lockdowns and not by the virus! And that this can also be proven by looking at the data.</span></p></a>
<a id="I53" spellcheck><h2>Immune System not a Topic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that before Corona during the flu season one important topic in the media always was how to strengthen your immune system. And that now, in the Corona time, this is strangely enough no longer important.</span></p></a>
<a id="I54" spellcheck><h2>False positive rate high</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that at low prevalence - spread of the virus - mass tests of healthy people have an exorbitantly high false positive rate. And that other factors in the test procedure also negatively influence this rate and are not transparent. <b> Idiots?!</b></span></p></a>
<a id="I55" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccines dangerous</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that mRNA vaccines, that are now used on a massive scale against the virus, have never been approved before. And that nothing can be known about the long-term consequences.</span></p></a>
<a id="I56" spellcheck><h2>Forced vaccination comes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that one will not get around getting vaccinated, because although there is no obligation in many countries, the pressure will be very high. And that without vaccination you will be denied many things (e.g. travel, culture etc.).</span></p></a>
<a id="I57" spellcheck><h2>Youtube deletes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that YouTube is deleting critical videos on the virus topic and blocks, demonetizes and shadowbans channels. And that their decisions are only based on whether the content is in line with the official narrative. And that one should therefore not rely on YouTube an more.</span></p></a>
<a id="I58" spellcheck><h2>Hyper inflation is coming</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the large amount of money currently being printed and distributed in industrialized nations worldwide to support the losers of the crisis increases the risk of hyper inflation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I59" spellcheck><h2>Hearing other experts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are also countless experts who see the current virus crisis with completely different eyes. And that their competence is just as relevant as that of the experts who follow the official narrative.</span></p></a>
<a id="I60" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects known</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the rush-developed Corona vaccines have led to severe adverse effects and deaths in their radically shortened test phases. And that it is irresponsible to use them for mass vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I61" spellcheck><h2>World government</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are open plans and activities to centralize governmental power in global institutions in the coming years as the virus crisis continues. And that as a result we are heading for an authoritarian and technocratic world government.</span></p></a>
<a id="I62" spellcheck><h2>Democracy at its end</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our democratic order is in great danger because of the crisis and especially because of the measures decreed. And that it is currently not foreseeable that the state of emergency with suspension of basic rights will be reversed at all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I63" spellcheck><h2>Insolvency of Capitalism</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the globalized, neoliberal turbo-capitalism has once again reached the end of its cycle. And that its collapse is being disguised by the virus crisis and is currently being resolved to the advantage of the elites.</span></p></a>
<a id="I64" spellcheck><h2>Hundreds of other viruses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are hundreds of other viruses besides the SARS-Cov-2, which manifest themselves in respiratory diseases with comparable symptoms. And that the human organism is typically affected by many of these viruses at the same time and therefore testing for only one of them is hardly meaningful.</span></p></a>
<a id="I65" spellcheck><h2>Listen to critics, too</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that listening to science would require acknowledging scientific contradictions and making the scientific discourse that has emerged visible to the public and the media. And that anything else is not science at all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I66" spellcheck><h2>Treatment long available</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that several even inexpensive treatments for COVID have long been available. And that there is just no money to be made with and therefore they are withhold or even discredited.</span></p></a>
<a id="I67" spellcheck><h2>Forced digitization</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the digital economy is receiving a strong boost in the wake of the virus crisis. And that with the realization of digital identity solutions in conjunction with immunity passes, it will quickly and radically transform our world in the direction of a technocracy.</span></p></a>
<a id="I68" spellcheck><h2>Protect risk groups</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it would be much more sensible if not all healthy people took measures to protect others, but only the risk groups would take measures to protect themselves. And that many epidemiologists and immunologists see it that way, too.</span></p></a>
<a id="I69" spellcheck><h2>No Pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is no overall statistical excess mortality compared to earlier years. And that this is proof enough that we are not dealing with an epidemic or medical crisis!</span></p></a>
<a id="I70" spellcheck><h2>Flu season every year</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that every year during the flu season, respiratory illnesses spike and hospitals are overwhelmed. And that therefore what we're experiencing now is no special situation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I71" spellcheck><h2>Crisis substitute for war</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the crisis is being deliberately countered with unsuitable measures to destroy as much as possible, as in a war. And that capitalism has always rehabilitated itself this way!</span></p></a>
<a id="I72" spellcheck><h2>ct value not standardized</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is no fixed threshold of the ct-value - meaning the number of reproduction cycles as a measure for the existing virus load - for the PCR&nbsp;test to evaluate as positive! And that this test can thus be politically abused in any way.</span></p></a>
<a id="I73" spellcheck><h2>Use your brain!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that one should not be put into fear and apathy by the media but use one's mind to evaluate the openly available information. And that one would then come to different conclusions!</span></p></a>
<a id="I74" spellcheck><h2>Wake up!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that anyone who hasn't noticed that a false game is being played here can no longer be rescued. And that during this crisis everyone can know on which side they would have been in Germany in the 1930s.</span></p></a>
<a id="I75" spellcheck><h2>Herd immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that herd immunity is not a strategy but simply a fact. And that in most countries it probably has long been achieved since the beginning of the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I76" spellcheck><h2>T-cell immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that we don't need to be vaccinated on a large scale because a large part of the population already has basic T-cell immunity from expositions to similar viruses. And that the pharmaceutical industry suppresses this information.</span></p></a>
<a id="I77" spellcheck><h2>Filter bubble</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that people who rely on mass media are in a filter bubble when it comes to the virus issue. And that this filter bubble massively distorts their perception of reality.</span></p></a>
<a id="I78" spellcheck><h2>Financial incentives</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in many countries Corona case numbers and intensive care bed occupancy are being driven up by financial incentives. And that through these incentives more money can be earned with both positively tested treated and deceased patients.</span></p></a>
<a id="I79" spellcheck><h2>Milgram Experiment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that we are currently in the middle of a huge, unprecedented human experiment. And that it resembles, among others, the frightening Milgram experiment, which tested the effect of authority on humans.</span></p></a>
<a id="I80" spellcheck><h2>Healthcare was Cut Back</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that politics before Corona has cut back the national health system in various ways and so that its overloading is now to be expected. And that they have not changed anything since the beginning of the crisis!</span></p></a>
<a id="I81" spellcheck><h2>Dark Winter</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the winter 2020/2021 is since long called &lsquo;Dark Winter&rsquo; by the insider &lsquo;planners&rsquo; of this crisis. And that we have to be prepared for many more planned deprivations!</span></p></a>
<a id="I82" spellcheck><h2>Pressure from above?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are indications that politicians and officials are getting pressure &lsquo;from above&rsquo; nationally and internationally, for example from the IMF, to approve or implement harmful measures. And that they probably even have made an example of some critics centererging too much!</span></p></a>
<a id="I83" spellcheck><h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that studies show that vitamin&nbsp;D deficiency significantly worsens the course of COVID diseases. And that the prescription of vitamin&nbsp;D alone promises massive success in prevention and treatment!</span></p></a>
<a id="I84" spellcheck><h2>Fact checkers biased</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the many fact checkers on the Corona issue are not driven by the truth, but by interests. And that they therefore are the real life equivalent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's &lsquo;1984&rsquo;!</span></p></a>
<a id="I85" spellcheck><h2>People always die</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that death is the only certainty in life. And that a painful death, as it is regularly reported in the media right now in connection with Corona, was also the norm in the time before Corona.</span></p></a>
<a id="I86" spellcheck><h2>Postponed OPs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that millions of scheduled OPs have been postponed worldwide, and people in general have foregone medical checks and treatments out of fear. And that this has led to much more premature suffering and death.</span></p></a>
<a id="I87" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns ineffective</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that measures such as lockdowns and school closures have had and continue to have no effect on Corona infection incidence. And that, in contrast, these are causing more and more suffering and death in other areas.</span></p></a>
<a id="I88" spellcheck><h2>Staying Alive not Living</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span> that we are losing sight of living for staying alive. And that the currently imposed measures like lockdowns and curfews falsely suggest to people that staying alive equals living.</span></p></a>
<a id="I89" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine there too fast</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the development of working mRNA vaccines for Corona started much too early and has been successful far too quickly compared to previous experiences. And that this should be cause for very critical consideration!</span></p></a>
<a id="I90" spellcheck><h2>1984</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the current situation is very reminiscent of the dystopia &lsquo;1984&rsquo; by George Orwell. And that it was certainly not meant to be an template or instruction manual!</span></p></a>
<a id="I91" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination senseless</h2>
<p>They say <i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a vaccination makes little sense, since among other things its effectiveness is not known and already infected persons do not need it at all. And that the vaccination brings us no step closer to a normalization of our lives.</span></p></a>
<a id="I92" spellcheck><h2>Guinea Pigs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the inadequate testing of the vaccines, their forced fast-track approval, and the already known adverse effects only suggest that the current mass vaccination is an irresponsible human experiment.</span></p></a>
<a id="I93" spellcheck><h2>Not about health</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our politics is neither concerned about our health nor about our healthcare system, since it would have acted completely different otherwise today and in the last decades!</span></p></a>
<a id="I94" spellcheck><h2>Artists stand up</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that more and more artists are reminding themselves on their role as critical commentators on our world. And that Eric Clapton and Van Morrison are particularly noteworthy in this regard!</span></p></a>
<a id="I95" spellcheck><h2>Herd Immunity Criteria</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that beginning with the Corona vaccination, the WHO has changed its definition of herd immunity so that natural immunity no longer has any meaning. And that it therefore can only be achieved through vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I96" spellcheck><h2>First vaccination victims</h2>
<p>They say<i> yet all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are already first victims of the vaccination, which are barely covered in the mass media. And that this was predictable given the rush in which the vaccines were developed and tested.</span></p></a>
<a id="I97" spellcheck><h2>We all get chipped</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the ultimate goal of introducing a worldwide vaccination regime is to bring all people under control via micro-chips. And that this will also involve ubiquitous networking with 5G.</span></p></a>
<a id="I98" spellcheck><h2>Won't go away</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that corona finally has to be considered as just another of many infectious diseases we humans have to live with. And that there are simply no measures to make it disappear again.</span></p></a>
<a id="I99" spellcheck><h2>Oath of Hippocrates</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that physicians commit themselves according to the Oath of Hippocrates to &lsquo;first do no harm&rsquo; (primum non nocere) to their patients. And that for this reason alone they would have to reject the Covid measures because of their harmfulness.</span></p></a>
<a id="I100" spellcheck><h2>My Body my Choice</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that each incenteridual has the right to decide freely over its body. And that this freedom of choice is under threat with the Corona vaccine regime.</span></p></a>
<a id="I101" spellcheck><h2>Virus from the Lab</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is a lot of serious evidence that the virus was made in a lab. And that as part of &lsquo;gain of function&rsquo; research, viruses have been purposefully made more dangerous for many years.</span></p></a>
<a id="I102" spellcheck><h2>AutoImmune overreaction</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that after vaccination against the virus there is a risk of a life-threatening overreaction of the immune system on contact with the real pathogen. And that this could make many vaccinated people victims in the future.</span></p></a>
<a id="I103" spellcheck><h2>Infertility</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the spike protein permanently generated in the body after mRNA vaccination could also have an influence on reproduction. And that therefore the risk of infertility cannot be ruled out.</span></p></a>
<a id="I104" spellcheck><h2>Allergic reactions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that certain components of the vaccines can cause allergic reactions. And that this can have potenetially fatal consequences for some people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I105" spellcheck><h2>Risk of genetic alterations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the mRNA administered with some vaccines carries the risk of being incorporated into human genome. And that this effect has also long been used in genetic modification of plants via transgenes.</span></p></a>
<a id="I106" spellcheck><h2>Not a true placebo</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the placebos administered to the comparison groups in vaccine test runs typically also contains most components of the vaccine itself. And that in this way the results are deliberately falsified.</span></p></a>
<a id="I107" spellcheck><h2>How do you tell your children?</h2>
<p>They do ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>if you are clear about the dystopian future you would be leaving your own children and grandchildren by inaction. And what you want to answer them when they ask why you allowed this to happen?</span></p></a>
<a id="I108" spellcheck><h2>What about Belarus?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Belarus has decided against lockdowns and other measures, contrary to IMF requirements. And that everyday life there has continued as normal and no medical crisis has erupted.</span></p></a>
<a id="I109" spellcheck><h2>Recession already here</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the greatest recession of modern times is already in full swing. And that this damage is not due to the virus but to inappropriate policy decisions around the world.</span></p></a>
<a id="I110" spellcheck><h2>Double Standards</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the many double standards, e.g. for sports, the police, railroads and airplanes are an unmistakable sign of large-scale misdirection. And that all you have to do is look closely!</span></p></a>
<a id="I111" spellcheck><h2>Good and bad protests</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the state authority intervenes world-wide completely obviously mostly with unpleasant protests, e.g. by punishing offences against distancing and mask obligations. And that they completely ridicule themselves with that.</span></p></a>
<a id="I112" spellcheck><h2>Virus Patents</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that not only has research on coronaviruses been going on for years with government funds, but that there are even patents on virus variants. And that these patents are held by US government organizations.</span></p></a>
<a id="I113" spellcheck><h2>It's not a vaccine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that &lsquo;vaccine&rsquo; is a legally defined term in health law. And that mRNA in a fat coat that causes human cells to produce pathogens does not fall under that definition - which makes all whats currently happening illegal.</span></p></a>
<a id="I114" spellcheck><h2>Füllmich sues ...</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a global team of lawyers led by consumer protection attorney Rainer Füllmich will soon end the crisis by taking all those responsible to courts worldwide!</span></p></a>
<a id="I115" spellcheck><h2>Third Wave is the Jab</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is countless evidence that people often test positive, fall ill and even die for the virus immediately after vaccination. And that a third wave could also be created in this way.</span></p></a>
<a id="I116" spellcheck><h2>Virus not isolated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the virus has still not been isolated as required by Koch's postulates. And that this alone should be enough to stop the whole thing immediately.</span></p></a>
<a id="I117" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated further contagious</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinated persons, according to official data, can continue the virus to pass on to others. And that this measure therefore cannot be a way out of the official crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I118" spellcheck><h2>The App in Moscow</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that anyone who wants to see what dystopian conditions we've reached, should only look at the Russian quarantine monitoring app - where machines are already monitoring people in captivity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I119" spellcheck><h2>Gibraltar after vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the numbers in Gibraltar show quite clearly that it was only when vaccination began that a massive wave of disease set in. And that this is evidence enough that vaccination is for entirely different purposes.</span></p></a>
<a id="I120" spellcheck><h2>Upward redistribution</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide states and economies are being forced to sell off possessions, companies and shares via the lockdowns. And that this will lead to a huge wave of redistribution, allowing big business and hedge funds to convert their wealth.</span></p></a>
<a id="I121" spellcheck><h2>45 cycles is a crime</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it was and is PCR testing practice in many countries to consider ct cycles of 35-45 still as positive. And since this range allows no meaningful conclusions about an infection, it can only be considered as a crime.</span></p></a>
<a id="I122" spellcheck><h2>Pharma: Healthy people?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the confidence of many in the vaccine manufacturers is completely naive. And that whoever believes that the pharmaceutical industry wants healthy people also believes that the defense industry wants world peace.</span></p></a>
<a id="I123" spellcheck><h2>Symptoms not unique</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Covid disease has no unique symptoms distinguishable from countless other respiratory diseases at all. And that this way in many countries, without testing, everyone is simply added to the Covid statistics.</span></p></a>
<a id="I124" spellcheck><h2>Vitamin C</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vitamin C has been shown to reduce the propensity for oxidative stress, cytokine storm, and thrombosis in viral infections. And that therefore viral diseases such as COVID-19 should be treated with high-dose vitamin C therapy.</span></p></a>
<a id="I125" spellcheck><h2>Original virus nonexistant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the virus of origin, Sars-Cov-2, has already ceased to exist since the fall of 2020, and only mutations of it remained. And that the current media representation has nothing at all to do with this reality.</span></p></a>
<a id="I126" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns unprecedented</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the measure of economic lockdowns to contain a pandemic has never even been considered before Wuhan. And that there remains no robust evidence that it is effective, but countless that it causes untold suffering.</span></p></a>
<a id="I127" spellcheck><h2>Mutants billion-dollar business</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the virus mutants now regularly discussed in the media will provide pharmaceutical companies with permanent billions in revenue in the future from ever new vaccines and tests. And that this is not a medical necessity!</span></p></a>
<a id="I128" spellcheck><h2>Dues will rise</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the crisis will really get going when the state and insurance companies make up for their financial losses by raising taxes and contributions. And that this will again only burden the middle class.</span></p></a>
<a id="I129" spellcheck><h2>Politicians above the law</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the many cases in which politicians and officials themselves have flouted the rules they have imposed are a clear sign that they themselves do not believe in the propagated dangerousness either.</span></p></a>
<a id="I130" spellcheck><h2>Death certificates falsified</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that covid death statistics are massively inflated by manipulating death certificates in many countries. And that this manipulation is motivated by systemic pressures and incentives.</span></p></a>
<a id="I131" spellcheck><h2>Zanzibar / Tanzania</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the country of Tanzania, which has taken no anti-viral measures, shows that the crisis has no threatening medical dimension. And that ongoing tourism there is the best proof for this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I132" spellcheck><h2>Masks a Torture Tool</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the forced wearing of surgical masks is an instrument of torture. And that at Guantanamo it is used to terrorize all inmates through diminished oxygenation and sensory deprivation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I133" spellcheck><h2>Home office makes lonely</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i>, <span>that forced distancing, for example by working in home office, makes people lonely and triggers mental illnesses. And that unstable and sensitive people in particular are among the victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="I134" spellcheck><h2>New normal permanently</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the &lsquo;New Normality&rsquo; is not something temporary but a permanently changed world. And that this also emerges unmistakably from the statements of those responsible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I135" spellcheck><h2>Cracking down on critics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide the executive is rigorously cracking down on critical activists, doctors and lawyers. And that in doing so, means in the legal gray area and also clearly unlawful means are being used.</span></p></a>
<a id="I136" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination favors mutations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that because the new vaccines do not achieve sterile immunity and vaccinated people thus continue to be contagious, the emergence of new viral mutations is massively favored. And that this has not been sufficiently considered!</span></p></a>
<a id="I137" spellcheck><h2>Politicians just our employees</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that our politicians were elected by us to enforce the interests of us as citizens. And that if they don't do what we want, we have to fire them - that's democracy!</span></p></a>
<a id="I138" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination ID coming</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the digital, worldwide valid vaccination card for all is just being fast-tracked. And that once it's there, it will be used as a legitimization for discriminating against people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I139" spellcheck><h2>Fourth estate missing</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the media is the fourth estate in society, which has the role of critically accompanying the rulers. And that currently, without serious criticism, we lack this corrective.</span></p></a>
<a id="I140" spellcheck><h2>Influencers harnessed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many celebrities and influencers are not accidentally using their reach to spread the Corona narrative, but are part of a well-organized propaganda campaign!</span></p></a>
<a id="I141" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination increases mortality</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i>, <span>that mortality rates worldwide have been rising since vaccination campaigns began. And that it can no longer be covered up that the experimental vaccines are to blame!</span></p></a>
<a id="I142" spellcheck><h2>Israel Human Lab</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in Israel, since vaccination, the risk of death is hundreds of times higher compared to the disease, especially among young people. And that the country can only be considered a big human laboratory!</span></p></a>
<a id="I143" spellcheck><h2>There is no &lsquo;the science&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is no single &lsquo;the science&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;the truth&rsquo;. Science relies on hypothesis, experiment, validation or falsification. And that whoever uses the term in this way has not understood the principles of science and is instead inclined to scientism.</span></p></a>
<a id="I144" spellcheck><h2>What about Florida?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Florida never had mandatory masks, the beaches were never closed, and since September 2020 all kids have been going to school normally. And that even so, fewer people have died from Corona than the U.S. average.</span></p></a>
<a id="I145" spellcheck><h2>What about North and South Dakota?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that North and South Dakota had the same pandemic development, even though stringent measures were imposed in one part and none at all in the other. And that that is evidence enough that the measures are ineffective.</span></p></a>
<a id="I146" spellcheck><h2>What about Texas?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the governor of Texas repealed the lockdown and all Corona measures in March 2021. And that the fact that it hasn't had any effect on the already low casualty numbers since then shows the general futility of these regulatory interventions.</span></p></a>
<a id="I147" spellcheck><h2>Pollutants in masks/tests</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that toxic substances and harmful materials have been found in corona masks and also on the sticks of test kits. And that you would only harm yourself if you used these things.</span></p></a>
<a id="I148" spellcheck><h2>Nuremberg Laws</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide partially forced vaccination with experimental, sparely tested substances violates the Nuremberg Laws, because people are clearly being abused as guinea pigs here, as they were then.</span></p></a>
<a id="I149" spellcheck><h2>Second Nuremberg Trials</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that thousands of lawyers worldwide are preparing trials comparable to the Nuremberg Trials. And that we are dealing with crimes against humanity in both the Corona swindle and the vaccine experiments.</span></p></a>
<a id="I150" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine apartheid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the measure to grant more rights to the vaccinated than to the unvaccinated, which is currently being pushed by politicians worldwide, is a clearly unlawful discrimination. And that excesses of this discrimination in some countries are already tantamount to a kind of apartheid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I151" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination card dystopian</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Digital Vaccination Card, which is being established worldwide at full pace, leads directly to an authoritarian dystopia, since it can be very easily technically advanced into a Chinese-style social credit system.</span></p></a>
<a id="I152" spellcheck><h2>Discourse deliberately poisoned</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the public and scientific discourse around the Corona issue is being deliberately sabotaged by media and influence agents. And that to this end, critics are not only defamed and labeled, but also damaged and their very existence threatened.</span></p></a>
<a id="I153" spellcheck><h2>Not proportionate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is a legal principle that measures intended to achieve a legitimate purpose must be suitable, necessary and proportionate. And that this consideration was never properly carried out for the current Corona measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I154" spellcheck><h2>Positive is not infected</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that PCR tests, nor any of the other tests currently in use, can detect a viral infection. And that therefore publicly referring to those who test positive as &lsquo;newly infected&rsquo; or their numbers as &lsquo;incidence&rsquo; is completely misleading.</span></p></a>
<a id="I155" spellcheck><h2>Doctors have tunnel view</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that doctors are ill-suited to be witnesses to the crisis, since they are confronted only with illness, suffering, and death, and do not always overlook the reasons for their situation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I156" spellcheck><h2>Children not drivers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that children, because of their typically strong immune systems, put respiratory viruses away well and don't get sick very often. And that they therefore can't be drivers of a pandemic and are unnecessarily overrun with measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I157" spellcheck><h2>Testing unnecessary</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that undergoing a Corona test as a healthy person is completely unnecessary. And that whoever does a test to know if he is sick, probably also goes regularly to the cemetery to know if he is already dead.</span></p></a>
<a id="I158" spellcheck><h2>Not exponential</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the epidemic spread of a viral disease just does not proceed exponentially but decays very quickly in the form of a bell curve. And that the decreasing number of potential hosts and their ever increasing immunity contributes to this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I159" spellcheck><h2>Long Flu</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the proportion of long-term sequelae in covid disease is as high as in influenza, at about 5%. And that we are not dealing with a specificity of this disease, just as we are with other symptoms, such as loss of the olfactory sense.</span></p></a>
<a id="I160" spellcheck><h2>Nothing learned</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that after the fascism experiences in Europe one wanted to prevent a repetition by comprehensive enlightenment in the school. And that these efforts were in vain, because right at the first global fascist coup the majority of the population falls for the old patterns again.</span></p></a>
<a id="I161" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates no mask</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Bill Gates has never been seen wearing a mask. And that this is a clear indication of who is really pulling the strings.</span></p></a>
<a id="I162" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is gene therapy</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Corona vaccinations are a never-before-approved gene therapy intervention on humans. And that the name &lsquo;vaccination&rsquo; was chosen only because it is positively associated with most people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I163" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects not reported</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the adverse effects rate is heavily skewed because most adverse effects, especially deaths, are not even recorded. And that many studies suggest that this reporting rate is in the single digits.</span></p></a>
<a id="I164" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine shedding</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination are harmful substances that are excreted by the body of vaccinated persons. And that in this way they can also harm unvaccinated people in their vicinity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I165" spellcheck><h2>Covid vascular disease</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Covid is actually a vascular disease in which the immune response to the spike proteins of the viral envelope interferes with oxygen transport in the lungs, for example. And that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination could exacerbate this effect.</span></p></a>
<a id="I166" spellcheck><h2>Thrombosis due to spike proteins</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination are harmful substances that lead to thrombosis through immune reaction. And that here the long-term effects, which have not been investigated, could lead to fatal consequences for those vaccinated.</span></p></a>
<a id="I167" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating children crime</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a red line has been crossed by trying to enforce vaccination of children as well. And that children are at a much higher risk from vaccination than from the disease itself.</span></p></a>
<a id="I168" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating Placebo Luck</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that with that the happiness and liberation that many feel after vaccination is only the falling away of their irrational fear. And that one can only hope that none of the lucky ones will come down with severe adverse effects in the months or years to come.</span></p></a>
<a id="I169" spellcheck><h2>Gurgling is enough</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that regular gargling with appropriate means would be completely sufficient to prevent the virus already from the entrance into the own body. And that all the measures and also the vaccination would be superfluous if everyone did that.</span></p></a>
<a id="I170" spellcheck><h2>Deaths added up</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the ever-increasing numbers of covid victims are due to the fact that they are not recounted seasonally as with the flu, but added up as individual waves a large &lsquo;pandemic&rsquo;. And that by splitting them up, you would be back to the dimensions of the flu.</span></p></a>
<a id="I171" spellcheck><h2>Mistreatment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a large proportion of the covid deaths would have been preventable if they had been treated early and properly. And that this is partly because well-studied and effective drugs like hydroxychloroquine or ivermecin would be suppressed in parts of the world.</span></p></a>
<a id="I172" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theories true</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many of the critics' predictions, such as the introduction of a digital vaccination card or even mandatory vaccination, which were initially dismissed as nonsense, have now come true. And that people just aren't looking closely enough to notice.</span></p></a>
<a id="I173" spellcheck><h2>New way of counting</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide, through regulatory and statistical sleight of hand, attempts are being made to portray the vaccination campaign as a success. And that everyone who looks at this should actually be able to see through this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I174" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination site magnetic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many vaccinated people found that their upper arm is now magnetic at the injection site. And since this effect cannot be explained with the official contents materials of the vaccines, we with the vaccination apparently are fooled.</span></p></a>
<a id="I175" spellcheck><h2>Like &lsquo;The Wave&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the behavior of the majority of people in crisis is very much like that of the students in the well-known movie &lsquo;The Wave.&rsquo; And that the lessons learned in the film can be directly applied to our current reality.</span></p></a>
<a id="I176" spellcheck><h2>No sterile immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that none of the vaccines approved against the virus achieve sterile immunity, after which infection of others is no longer possible. And that therefore linking &lsquo;relaxations&rsquo; to vaccination is completely pointless.</span></p></a>
<a id="I177" spellcheck><h2>AIDS segments in the virus</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the genome of the virus has been shown to contain distinctive segments of the AIDS virus. And that this is so unlikely that this fact can be taken as evidence that the virus was created by the so-called gene scissors in the lab.</span></p></a>
<a id="I178" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine damage-dark figure high</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that already always with vaccinations only 1-10% of the adverse effect and death cases are reported. And that even in the case of this virus, there is a demonstrably large number of unreported cases, and a large proportion of these reactions go under the radar.</span></p></a>
<a id="I179" spellcheck><h2>Trans-Humanism Agenda</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that one of the big agendas behind the crisis is that of so-called transhumanisnus, which stands for a merging of man and machine. And that its elitist proponents envision the immortality of their own souls as a distant goal.</span></p></a>
<a id="I180" spellcheck><h2>The virus is a hoax</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all the fuss about the virus is its supposed dangerousness a single hoax, serving the worldwide enforcement of other big plans. And that this will also soon become apparent.</span></p></a>
<a id="I181" spellcheck><h2>Will endure the virus</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that their personal immune systems are strong enough to withstand an illness with the virus without damage. And that they therefore not only do not take the measures seriously a vaccination is out of the question for them.</span></p></a>
<a id="I182" spellcheck><h2>Only Emergency Admissions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all vaccines worldwide have only a limited emergency approval, which does not justify the careless vaccination of a large part of the world's population at all. And that this approval would be null and void the moment the pandemic was declared over.</span></p></a>
<a id="I183" spellcheck><h2>Won't stop at 1x</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that if you think you are out of responsibility with one round of vaccination, you have miscalculated. And that it is already foreseeable that one's own vaccination, with all its risks, will have to be renewed at least every year.</span></p></a>
<a id="I184" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Gain of Function&rsquo; research</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that research has been going on for decades with government money into using corona and other viruses as bio-weapons. And you can possibly trace the current virus back to this &lsquo;gain-of-function&rsquo; research as well, which most recently took place in Wuhan.</span></p></a>
<a id="I185" spellcheck><h2>Triage in child psychiatry</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that while the world is more or less successful in preventing triage for respiratory problems caused by the virus, at the same time there has long been triage for mental health problems, especially in children.</span></p></a>
<a id="I186" spellcheck><h2>Eugenics link</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that links to the eugenics movement can be found not only among Bill Gates but among many other players in the crisis, such as the Moderna developers. And that this is an indication that the global push for mass vaccination may also be about population reduction.</span></p></a>
<a id="I187" spellcheck><h2>Ivermecin</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that great success has been achieved with the malaria drug ivermecin in the treatment of corona sufferers, which has also been proven by studies. And that this drug is nonetheless suppressed in many countries around the world and is not available to doctors for treatment.</span></p></a>
<a id="I188" spellcheck><h2>Hydroxychloroquine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that hydroxychloroquine is a simple, over-the-counter treatment available almost anywhere in the world for respiratory diseases like corona. And that its widespread use was successfully prevented by the pharmaceutical industry through a rigged study in 2020.</span></p></a>
<a id="I189" spellcheck><h2>Absolute risk reduction</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the absolute risk reduction for all approved vaccines is only in the range of 1%, so they have no effect on the overall population. And that you can prove anything with numbers, if you present them in the appropriate way.</span></p></a>
<a id="I190" spellcheck><h2>Neofeudalism</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the concentration of wealth among fewer and fewer people has accelerated further with the crisis. And that the unequal power relations that result are already tantamount to a kind of new feudalism.</span></p></a>
<a id="I191" spellcheck><h2>You'll own nothing</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that among the visions formulated for the period after the Great Reset 2015 is the happy renunciation of property for the 99%. And that the 1% super-rich are excluded here, of course.</span></p></a>
<a id="I192" spellcheck><h2>Klaus Schwab</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that just a few months after the crisis began, World Economic Forum chief Klaus Schwab has already laid out in a book how it must be urgently used as a unique &lsquo;window of opportunity&rsquo; to implement the changes in the world that the powerful now believe are called for.</span></p></a>
<a id="I193" spellcheck><h2>Young Global Leaders</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the World Economic Forum has long trained top politicians in its Young Global Leaders program to advance its interests worldwide. And that from this cadre comes not only the current German Chancellor Merkel, but also the upcoming Chancellor Baerbock!</span></p></a>
<a id="I194" spellcheck><h2>Stakeholder Capitalism</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the WEF's Great Reset envisions nothing less than the reshaping of the global economy into a stakeholder capitalism dominated by a few large corporations, so that these stakeholders will then take responsibility for resources and environmental protection.</span></p></a>
<a id="I195" spellcheck><h2>Next: climate change</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Great Reset, by being a concentration of economic power in a few stakeholders, should also solve the responsibility problem of global climate change. And that every individual will soon also have to reckon with repressive restrictions on freedom in favor of the climate.</span></p></a>
<a id="I196" spellcheck><h2>Protests hushed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that most people are unaware of the massive opposition to the Corona agenda, as ongoing protests of several hundred thousand people worldwide, for example in Berlin or London, are simply downplayed, defamed, or kept quiet altogether by the media.</span></p></a>
<a id="I197" spellcheck><h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the corona virus is also a virus that is only seasonally active, and that the much-cited &lsquo;waves&rsquo; can be explained as seasonal waves. And that it is therefore misleading to keep adding up the victims of these waves.</span></p></a>
<a id="I198" spellcheck><h2>Bio-weapons deployments?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they can certainly imagine that some outbreaks since the beginning of the crisis could be traced to the use of the virus as a bioweapon. And that if so, the conspirators would have all the means in hand to maintain fear and states of emergency until their plans were implemented.</span></p></a>
<a id="I199" spellcheck><h2>mRNA nanoparticles</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that mRNA vaccines are injected in lipid nanoparticles, typically SM-102. And that these nanoparticles are highly dangerous and not intended for human use at all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I200" spellcheck><h2>Insolvencies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that countless companies around the world have been driven into insolvency by lockdowns. And that these bankruptcies threaten the livelihoods of many more people than the virus ever could. And that the effects have been delayed in some countries by changes in the law.</span></p></a>
<a id="I201" spellcheck><h2>Agenda Unstoppable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that those elites who are pursuing their own hidden agenda with the fake viral crisis have no other option at all but to keep pushing it. And that if people were to figure it out, they would face exposure and prosecution.</span></p></a>
<a id="I202" spellcheck><h2>US states without action</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in a large part of the especially Republican US states no measures apply anymore or never did. And that there are no negative effects to be observed there, which should raise critical questions in the rest of the world about their own policy on measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I203" spellcheck><h2>Masks and occupational safety</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in many countries recommended or even required professional dust masks may only be used for short periods of time and with breaks according to current occupational health and safety rules. And that these rules play virtually no role in public communication.</span></p></a>
<a id="I204" spellcheck><h2>20 years of adverse effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all vaccines used worldwide have caused far fewer adverse effects and deaths in the last 20 years combined than the Corona vaccines have caused in a few months. And that, unfortunately, all security mechanisms are failing here.</span></p></a>
<a id="I205" spellcheck><h2>Intellectuals silent</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the vast majority of artists and intellectuals have failed to understand the threat to their and humanity's future posed by the staged crisis. And that they have remained silent for fear of going viral or being ostracized by society.</span></p></a>
<a id="I206" spellcheck><h2>Social Credit System Coming</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that policymakers around the world are looking to the Chinese model to keep the population in check. And that solutions like the digital immunization card are right along the lines of China's social credit system.</span></p></a>
<a id="I207" spellcheck><h2>Job pressure to vaccinate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that while there is no vaccination requirement, people in certain professions around the world are effectively faced with the choice of getting vaccinated or losing their jobs. And that for many who have learned nothing else, that would be tantamount to a plunge into poverty.</span></p></a>
<a id="I208" spellcheck><h2>Full Admission Threatens</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the transition from emergency to full approval of Corona vaccines is the real danger, since manufacturers will no longer be subject to any obligations and can even change the ingredients after the fact.</span></p></a>
<a id="I209" spellcheck><h2>Corona is a cult</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Corona is a cult whose disciples identify themselves by meticulously wearing masks. And that vaccination is tantamount to an initiation ritual, and that continuous media pressure serves to consolidate the doctrine of salvation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I210" spellcheck><h2>Social Media Bots</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that interest groups have long been trying to assert their interests by cleverly influencing social media such as Twitter or Facebook by means of bots. And that one must therefore always be very cautious with sentiment received on these channels.</span></p></a>
<a id="I211" spellcheck><h2>China Blueprint</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that motivated by the crisis, China's repressive social model with full surveillance, social credit system, etc. is seen by politicians in the rest of the world as a blueprint for rebuilding their own societies. And that one should be on the lookout for what changes are coming.</span></p></a>
<a id="I212" spellcheck><h2>Social Distancing weakens</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that without infections our immune system is not trained and therefore Social Distancing is very harmful, especially for children. This is because a weak immune system may not be able to cope with even harmless germs in the future.</span></p></a>
<a id="I213" spellcheck><h2>Staying inside unhealthy</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that people become lonely due to induced anxiety and withdrawal in their homes, and not only psychologically damaged, but also physically, for example, by poor eating habits, lack of exercise and sunlight, and as a result also a weakened immune defense.</span></p></a>
<a id="I214" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated should not fly</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that some airlines advise vaccinated people not to fly or even exclude them from flights because they have an increased risk of thrombosis. And that those who have been vaccinated for the freedom to travel may soon have the opposite!</span></p></a>
<a id="I215" spellcheck><h2>Like a PsyOp</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corona measures enacted worldwide clearly have elements of psychological operation. Masks, for example, make wearers experience the dreaded disease via their own respiratory distress, social distancing lets others seem like potential risks rather than fellow human beings.</span></p></a>
<a id="I216" spellcheck><h2>mRNA unsuccessful for years</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that research on mRNA vaccines has been going on for many years without success. And that the safety problems due to which these vaccines were never approved still exist, and that only emergency approvals allowed them to be used at all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I217" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated Unwanted</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a general defensiveness toward the unvaccinated is leading to arbitrary exclusionary rules in more and more areas of life. And that this is deliberate, to act as indirect vaccination coercion.</span></p></a>
<a id="I218" spellcheck><h2>Vaginal bleeding</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that more and more cases of changes in female menstruation after vaccinations are an alarm signal that possibly the reproductive system is being affected. And that this signal should normally have led to a stop of vaccinations long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I219" spellcheck><h2>Heart muscle inflammation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that more and more cases of heart muscle inflammation after vaccinations are an alarm signal that life-threatening late effects are imminent. And that these signals should have led to a stop of the vaccinations in the normal case long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I220" spellcheck><h2>Phase 3 trials</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all vaccines are still in phase 3 of their trials, so all vaccinated are unpaid trial participants. And that the vast majority have never been informed of this fact.</span></p></a>
<a id="I221" spellcheck><h2>I am the control group</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they are, even without being vaccinated, study participants in the global vaccination experiment, only that they belong to the control group. And that they can only recommend this role.</span></p></a>
<a id="I222" spellcheck><h2>Adverse events difficult to report</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide the official registration of vaccine adverse effects is hampered by complicated procedures and high hurdles. And that, as a result, only a very small proportion are actually reported.</span></p></a>
<a id="I223" spellcheck><h2>Victims &lsquo;post-harvest&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that seasonal respiratory illnesses kill sometimes more sometimes less people during the cold season. And that if fewer died in the previous season, the survivors may get it the next season as a so-called &lsquo;post-harvest.&rsquo;</span></p></a>
<a id="I224" spellcheck><h2>Enough vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that for a herd immunity yes only an immunity is necessary with 60-70% of humans. And that you therefore do not vaccinate yourself but simply wait until enough others are immune or vaccinated.</span></p></a>
<a id="I225" spellcheck><h2>Concentrated patients</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that overload situations in hospitals during the crisis were the exception, not the rule. And that these exceptions were staged in part by concentrating patients in single hospitals for the media.</span></p></a>
<a id="I226" spellcheck><h2>Death from loneliness</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the many victims in old people's homes and nursing homes have arisen because these people have been deprived of contact with relatives and of their dignity and love of life. And that they have subsequently died miserably of food deprivation, dehydration and of and in loneliness.</span></p></a>
<a id="I227" spellcheck><h2>Studies concealed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the pharmaceutical industry is hiding many studies and results in connection with their research that would show how dangerous certain technologies are. And that we have been tricked here for decades already.</span></p></a>
<a id="I228" spellcheck><h2>Gates and Epstein close</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Gates' past close contacts with pedophile Lolita Island owner Jeffrey Epstein cost him his marriage. And that people who run in those criminal circles can never be trusted.</span></p></a>
<a id="I229" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination dependence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that because through the vaccination the human immune system is demonstrably reprogrammed and in the consequence not capable any more to cope with many pathogens, for vaccinated a lifelong dependence on follow-up vaccinations results. And that this ways no end of the new normal is to be expected.</span></p></a>
<a id="I230" spellcheck><h2>DNA databases</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that with all the testing it would have long been possible to create huge databases in which all of our DNA would be stored. And that such totalitarian horror scenarios as known from Holywood are suddenly becoming more real than we can imagine.</span></p></a>
<a id="I231" spellcheck><h2>Shock Doctrine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the deception of the public so aptly described by Naomi Klein is just taking place in exemplary fashion worldwide. And that only the majority including Ms. Klein herself has not yet understood this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I232" spellcheck><h2>Not vaccinate in pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a long-known epidemiological principle is not to vaccinate during an epidemic or pandemic. And that because this principle is currently ignored, we are far from overcoming it and will still have to deal with serious knock-on effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="I233" spellcheck><h2>McCarthy like attacks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that attacks against critics are taking place in many countries, strongly reminiscent of the McCarthy era. And that defamation, media baiting, disbarment, dismissals and account terminations, unnoticed by the public, are already common practise.</span></p></a>
<a id="I234" spellcheck><h2>Doctors don't want to get vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, according to surveys, the majority of doctors and hospital staff have no intention of getting vaccinated - but often do so anyway under pressure. And that they must know best why they think that way.</span></p></a>
<a id="I235" spellcheck><h2>High hourly wage in vaccination centres</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the very high hourly wages often paid to physicians in vaccination centres act as a reward and as hush money, leading them to act against their own oath. And that doctors have always been susceptible to this kind of external influence.</span></p></a>
<a id="I236" spellcheck><h2>Cancer amplified by vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination empirically strongly favours the development of cancers such as leukaemia and that in many patients cancers that have been overcome return. And that these signals should normally have led to a stop of the vaccinations long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I237" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems due to vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that heart attacks, blood pressure problems and cardiac arrhythmias (possibly also due to thrombosis) have statistically increased significantly since vaccination. And that these signals should normally have led to a stop of the vaccinations long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I238" spellcheck><h2>Insufficient education before vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinated persons are often not properly informed about the experimental nature of the vaccination, about ongoing studies and already known risks and side effects, although this is obligatory. And that this amounts to deception, for which the vaccinating doctors can be held liable.</span></p></a>
<a id="I239" spellcheck><h2>Side effect victims not covered</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are insufficient safeguards, let alone compensation, for victims of vaccine injuries, partly because of the extensive clauses that allow manufacturers to be exempted from liability.</span></p></a>
<a id="I240" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Outsourcing&rsquo; of discrimination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the blanket social exclusion of the unvaccinated, for example in the catering trade and at cultural events, even denies healthy people proof of their health by means of a test. And that the state is 'outsourcing' to the private sector compulsory measures that it cannot impose itself.</span></p></a>
<a id="I241" spellcheck><h2>Continued excess mortality since vaccination started</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the beginning of the vaccination campaign there has been a statistically significant, steadily increasing excess mortality worldwide, which cannot be explained by Corona victims. And that unrecognized vaccination side effects could be a plausible cause.</span></p></a>
<a id="I242" spellcheck><h2>Natural immunity durable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a natural immunity acquired through a corona and other viral infections offers a demonstrably permanent protection against the disease and also against contagion. And that therefore the temporary recognition of a recovery can not only be unscientific but also harmful due to the pressure to vaccinate despite immunity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I243" spellcheck><h2>Plane crashes since vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there has been a demonstrable increase in the number of exceptional situations in air traffic since the beginning of vaccinations. And that here, from pilots dying in flight to plane crashes, much would point to sudden deaths after vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I244" spellcheck><h2>Increasing accidents since vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the beginning of vaccinations, an increasing number of accidents such as falls due to weakness or dizziness and even car accidents have been observed in people's everyday lives, and there is much to suggest that these are after-effects of the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I245" spellcheck><h2>Dressed like monkeys by rules</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many measures prescribed by politics make less and less sense when looking at the respective situation and in the course of time, but are meanwhile implemented uncritically by a majority of people. And that this makes the strong impression of &lsquo;trained monkeys&rsquo;.</span></p></a>
<a id="I246" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Passed away suddenly and unexpectedly&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the beginning of vaccinations, reports in the media of &lsquo;sudden and unexpected&rsquo; deaths, for example in obituaries or in the death notices of celebrities, have greatly increased. And that there is much to suggest that these are effects of vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I247" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of the vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the feared &lsquo;pandemic of the unvaccinated&rsquo; will instead become a pandemic of the vaccinated, because they will increasingly be among the victims due to their weakened immune system and the (side) effects of the vaccines. And that this is what reality will show.</span></p></a>
<a id="I248" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine makes Corona</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination has been shown to produce corona-like symptoms in many vaccinated people, indistinguishable from the viral disease, via spike proteins produced in the body that correspond to those of the virus. And that thus the vaccination further prolongs the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I249" spellcheck><h2>Mass vaccination does nothing</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that mass vaccination is demonstrably useless, because statistically there is no correlation between vaccination rates and corona waves or outbreaks anywhere in the world. So vaccination is an ineffective medical measure at best.</span></p></a>
<a id="I250" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination lasts only shortly</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the vaccination effect, especially against common variants of the virus, lasts only a few months. And that therefore the safety that vaccinated people may feel is a deceptive one.</span></p></a>
<a id="I251" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination weakens immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination has been shown to weaken the immune system by &lsquo;reprogramming&rsquo; it to fight a single pathogen. And that vaccinated people subsequently become more and more susceptible to all other pathogens.</span></p></a>
<a id="I252" spellcheck><h2>PCR test unsuitable for diagnoses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the inventor of the PCR test himself, Kary Mulis, has described it as unsuitable for diagnostic purposes, since it can be used to detect &lsquo;anything you want&rsquo;. And that the whole Corona narrative, on the other hand, was based precisely on making appropriate diagnoses with this test.</span></p></a>
<a id="I253" spellcheck><h2>Conflicts of interest among decision-makers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that thousands of decision-makers in politics, institutions and the media worldwide have conflicts of interest on the Corona issue, which prevent them from making their decisions independently. And that this circumstance is responsible for one of the most damaging undesirable developments in human history.</span></p></a>
<a id="I254" spellcheck><h2>After the jab its too late</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinations have been implemented with such speed and vigor that by the time one learns of the disastrous side effects in one's own environment, it is already too late for the individual. And that waiting can therefore be a sensible strategy.</span></p></a>
<a id="I255" spellcheck><h2>Shame of side effects of vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many vaccinated people may already suspect the vaccination for their permanent side effects, but do not report this out of shame, let alone communicate it to their friends. And that in this way the important real picture from their own environment is distorted.</span></p></a>
<a id="I256" spellcheck><h2>Adverse event susceptibility of vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many vaccinated people blame everything but the vaccination for their permanent side effects. And that in this way the important real picture of the side effects from their own environment is distorted.</span></p></a>
<a id="I257" spellcheck><h2>Physicians' adverse event ignorance</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many doctors and medical staff blame everything but the vaccination for the obvious side effects of their patients. And that they thereby prolong the madness by subconsciously sealing off their own world view from possible doubts.</span></p></a>
<a id="I258" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated in ICUs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since vaccination, a steadily increasing number of vaccinated people end up in hospitals and intensive care units. And that these numbers are misrepresented and hidden from the public with various pretexts.</span></p></a>
<a id="I259" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated among Corona victims</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the vaccination, a steadily increasing number of vaccinated people are among the Corona victims. And that these figures are being played down and hidden from the public, for example on the grounds that they do not want to jeopardise the vaccination campaigns.</span></p></a>
<a id="I260" spellcheck><h2> &lsquo;unvaccinated&rsquo; after vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that people are still considered unvaccinated between their vaccinations and in the critical period 14 days after the second vaccination. And that if they fall ill or die during this time, they are wrongly included in the statistics as Corona victims and not as vaccination victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="I261" spellcheck><h2>Marburg is next</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, due to the public communication of various institutions and the ongoing vaccine research, the next virus can already be expected. And that it is very likely to be the Marburg virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="I262" spellcheck><h2>Corman-Drosten Report</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corman-Drosten report reveals that the PCR test paper crucial to the pandemic narrative was put through review in the spring of 2020 in an unrealistically short time, and that a subsequent proper review highlighted massive flaws. And that this must be classified as scientific misconduct if not fraud.</span></p></a>
<a id="I263" spellcheck><h2>Studies must be limited</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the current studies on the safety and efficacy of the Corona vaccines must be carried out on a limited number of participants in accordance with established regulations. And that they are unlawful because they are instead being conducted on the entire world population.</span></p></a>
<a id="I264" spellcheck><h2>Also for risk behaviour</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that demanded sanctions (such as higher health contributions, triage) against unvaccinated persons due to assumed additional risks for the health care system would then also have to be imposed fairly for any risky behaviour. Because this also statistically leads to a higher burden on hospitals.</span></p></a>
<a id="I265" spellcheck><h2>Also for unhealthy lifestyle</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that any sanctions required (such as higher health premiums, triage) against the unvaccinated due to assumed additional risks to the health care system would then fairly have to be imposed for an unhealthy lifestyle/nutrition as well. And that the immune system is a determining factor in hospitalization.</span></p></a>
<a id="I266" spellcheck><h2>Everyone ends up immunized</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are simply two routes to covid immunization: Vaccination or Corona infection. And that in the next few years, probably everyone will receive some kind of immunization, without the need for appropriate measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I267" spellcheck><h2>Waiting for dead vaccine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all current vaccines are based on experimental methods that have never been used on humans before, such as mRNA technology. And that they lack confidence in these and therefore prefer to wait for classical inactivated vaccines.</span></p></a>
<a id="I268" spellcheck><h2>Waiting for proper approval</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that all current vaccinations do not yet have a regular but only an emergency approval. And that one would therefore prefer to wait for a proper approval.</span></p></a>
<a id="I269" spellcheck><h2>Wait for effective vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the data show that the current vaccine products have only a weak and not lasting effect. And that it is therefore preferable to wait for products with better efficacy.</span></p></a>
<a id="I270" spellcheck><h2>Don't need a vaccination subscription</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination is designed as a &lsquo;subscription&rsquo; that requires permanent treatment to maintain its benefits. And that people themselves have had bad experiences with subscriptions in other contexts and therefore prefer to do without.</span></p></a>
<a id="I271" spellcheck><h2>Without vaccination already no triage</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that when the vaccination rate was still 0 in 2020, there was no overloading of hospitals or even a need for triage. And that this could be expected even less with the current high vaccination rate, if the vaccination has the promised effect.</span></p></a>
<a id="I272" spellcheck><h2>Ivermectin successful in India</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the 2015 Nobel Prize-winning preparation ivermectin has not only proven effective against covid in countless studies, but now also in practice. And that in certain parts of India, the whole thing has already led to permanent containment of the disease.</span></p></a>
<a id="I273" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination worse than disease</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corona vaccines have already produced such an unmanageable range of side effect diagnoses from blindness to thrombosis that in this case one can literally conclude that the therapy is worse than the disease itself.</span></p></a>
<a id="I274" spellcheck><h2>Restrictions due to politics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that continued social restrictions exist not because of the unvaccinated, but because of politicians who do not keep their promises and simply continue the paternalism of citizens without comprehensible reasons.</span></p></a>
<a id="I275" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not for health reasons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, according to surveys, very few people had themselves vaccinated out of health concerns. As a rule, the regaining of freedoms, freedom from time-consuming procedures and external pressure were cited as decisive reasons.</span></p></a>
<a id="I276" spellcheck><h2>All would have to test themselves</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that exempting vaccinated people from testing, even though they are similarly contagious when sick, is a counterproductive measure. And that a sensible testing strategy can only be the continued testing of everyone.</span></p></a>
<a id="I277" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is a risk</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that with every vaccination, but especially with the current experimental Corona vaccinations, one runs the risk of harming oneself. And that therefore, due to the right of self-determination, no one may be put under pressure of any kind to undergo this intervention.</span></p></a>
<a id="I278" spellcheck><h2>What about Waterford?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Irish town of Waterford has both an almost 100% vaccination rate and the highest covid rate in the country. And that this is a clear indication of the ineffectiveness or even harmfulness of vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I279" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not permanent</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the vaccination is not permanently effective, but requires &lsquo;refreshers&rsquo; at regular intervals. And that this is already foreseen in the plans of both manufacturers and governments worldwide.</span></p></a>
<a id="I280" spellcheck><h2>Safe through memory cells</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the fixation on antibody determination as proof of immunity assumes a false model of the human immune system. And that appropriate memory cells already provide effective immunity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I281" spellcheck><h2>Differences in vaccine doses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is a suspicion that the vaccine manufacturers, due to a lack of confidence in the safety of their own products, have in part circulated variants or even placebos. And that this explains the large differences in efficacy and side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="I282" spellcheck><h2>Corona continuous loop</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the official Corona &lsquo;truth&rsquo; is successfully put into people's heads by the propaganda technique of repetition. And that while the narrative runs in a continuous loop on all channels, critical voices are transported if then only sporadically as a &lsquo;fig leaf&rsquo;.</span></p></a>
<a id="I283" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not protect against severe course</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the promised protection of vaccination against severe covid has long since turned out to be a false promise. And that vaccination must therefore now be seen more as a risk than a preventive measure.</span></p></a>
<a id="I284" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not bring herd immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination, which does not prevent infection and transmission of the virus, purely logically can not bring herd immunity. And that all arguments in this direction are therefore invalid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I285" spellcheck><h2>Embarrassing politician masquerade</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that politicians and media representatives worldwide have been convicted of deliberately masquerading for media images. And that it is a no-go that these people impose regulations on the masses that they themselves do not abide by.</span></p></a>
<a id="I286" spellcheck><h2>Range of side effects obscured</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the wide range of different side effects of the novel vaccines, for example in the area of vascular and nervous diseases, obscure the connections. And that their proper investigation is long overdue.</span></p></a>
<a id="I287" spellcheck><h2>Prior knowledge of the pandemic obvious</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is a great deal of evidence of prior knowledge of the Corona pandemic among, for example, vaccine manufacturers and politicians involved. And that this raises suspicions of large-scale fraud and should have led to a criminal investigation long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I288" spellcheck><h2>Consider individual factors</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the question of whether the virus or the vaccine is dangerous has individually very different answers. Young people, for example, who now have thrombosis or heart problems due to the vaccination, would not have had a problem with the virus. And that vaccination can therefore also only be a personal decision without pressure.</span></p></a>
<a id="I289" spellcheck><h2>Other definitions amended</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in addition to the WHO definition of a pandemic, which was amended in 2009, other terms have since been officially redefined to fit, including herd immunity and vaccine. And that this clearly indicates influence by interest groups.</span></p></a>
<a id="I290" spellcheck><h2>Industry interests are exposed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the interests of, for example, the pharmaceutical and digital industries to sell specific products and solutions in the course of the crisis are completely exposed. And that for this reason alone, no end to the crisis can be expected.</span></p></a>
<a id="I291" spellcheck><h2>Investor interests are open</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the interests of financial groups like Blackrock and Vanguard to profit from the crisis to the maximum are completely exposed. And that for this reason alone, no end to the crisis is to be expected.</span></p></a>
<a id="I292" spellcheck><h2>Discrimination unscientific</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that regulations introduced worldwide to exclude the unvaccinated from society have no sound scientific basis but only serve to increase the pressure to vaccinate. And that these regulations cannot therefore be reconciled with protection against discrimination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I293" spellcheck><h2>Fraud in registration studies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the large vaccine manufacturers have long since been proven to have committed multiple frauds within the approval procedures and studies for the novel vaccines. And that with this knowledge the vaccines should have been taken off the market long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="I294" spellcheck><h2>Forced vaccination of tourists</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that you are now not even spared from compulsory vaccination as a traveller in other countries, as Indonesia has now introduced compulsory vaccination for tourists. And that as an unvaccinated person you should be very careful when planning your trip.</span></p></a>
<a id="I295" spellcheck><h2>Predictive Programming</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that long before the crisis we were already prepared for it by methods of predictive programming. And that this has already become a proven tool in recent history (Utopia, Vexille, V for Vendetta, Equilibrium, 1984, Demolition Man, Idiocracy, Simpsons, They Live etc.).</span></p></a>
<a id="I296" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccines never approved</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the mRNA vaccines that received emergency approval during the crisis had never received approval before in their 20 years of development. And that studies usually had to be stopped during the preclinical phase due to animals dying.</span></p></a>
<a id="I297" spellcheck><h2>Even zoo animals die from vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in the meantime not only zoo animals have received a Corona vaccination, but that even here side-effect victims have already been reported. And that this is a clear indication of the experimental nature of this approach.</span></p></a>
<a id="I298" spellcheck><h2>Blackened EU Treaties</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that hardly any representatives of the people within the EU have access to the unredacted contents of the contracts agreed with vaccine manufacturers. And that this is a clear sign of completely undemocratic processes and procedures by those responsible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I299" spellcheck><h2>Subscription-Fall</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many vaccinated people were lured into a kind of subscription trap and deceived about the fact that vaccination is a regular event. And that because of this, even prominent supporters have now come to a more critical stance on the vaccination campaign. (Jordan Peterson, for example)</span></p></a>
<a id="I300" spellcheck><h2>Know vaccination damage in the immediate environment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the small sample of one's own circle of acquaintances already produces severe vaccine damage. And that therefore the side effect rate must be much higher than officially stated.</span></p></a>
<a id="I301" spellcheck><h2>Corona in the USA was Remdesivir</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the widespread use of the drug Remdesevir, according to the official recommendation of the CDC, was responsible for a significant proportion of Corona deaths in the USA. And that this recommendation was even justified by studies that certified a high death rate for this drug.</span></p></a>
<a id="I302" spellcheck><h2>Corona in GB was Midazolam</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the widespread use of the palliative drug Midazolam according to the official recommendation of the NHS was responsible for a significant proportion of Corona deaths in Great Britain. And that here already the dosage recommendation is in a life-threatening range.</span></p></a>
<a id="I303" spellcheck><h2>Rockefeller Foundation involved</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that besides the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation also had a decisive influence on the genesis of the artificial Corona crisis. And that the interest here lies, among other things, in the promotion of a global infrastructure for vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I304" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems already in newborns</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that increased numbers of newborns whose mothers have been vaccinated are born with heart problems. And that these indications of the transition of undesirable side effects also via the reproductive system should definitely be taken seriously.</span></p></a>
<a id="I305" spellcheck><h2>It's just ... salami tactics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it's just a mask. It's only two weeks. It's only the non-systemic companies. It's just to flatten the curve. It's just for a few more weeks.  It's just to keep the hospitals from being overburdened. It's just an app. It's just a few more months. It's just a vaccine. It's just a vaccination certificate. It's just so you can travel. It's just a few more years...</span></p></a>
<a id="I306" spellcheck><h2>Spanish flu was vaccine related</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the millions of victims of the Spanish flu, always mentioned as a reference, were in fact not victims of a virus but of experimental treatments. And that one of these treatments was also a so-called vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I307" spellcheck><h2>Recovered only second-class immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, contrary to scientific reality, convalescent status is only a second-class immunity, even though it is demonstrably a better and lasting protection. And that this alone shows that political and not medical decisions are being made here.</span></p></a>
<a id="I308" spellcheck><h2>For now everything is Long Covid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many people tend to attribute current health complaints to a previous Corona infection. And that many studies on Long Covid also have no comparison group and link symptoms to a previous infection unchecked.</span></p></a>
<a id="I309" spellcheck><h2>Only works on Alpha and Beta</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that according to Pfizer, their vaccine is only effective against alpha and beta variants, for all others no statement can be made because no data are available.</span></p></a>
<a id="I310" spellcheck><h2>Delta only vaccination adverse events</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the effects of the so-called delta variant, which is actually less dangerous, are only effects of mass vaccination. And that further vaccination will keep the pandemic going.</span></p></a>
<a id="I311" spellcheck><h2>Regulatory studies manipulated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the manufacturers' Corona approval studies are heavily manipulated, such as removing vaccine victims from the study. And that the FDA has received and ignored much evidence of this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I312" spellcheck><h2>Why not all admitted?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is incomprehensible why, if vaccination is seen as the solution to the pandemic, major vaccine manufacturers are being excluded from supply in many parts of the world. And that alone makes it clear that this is not about urgent management of a medical crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I313" spellcheck><h2>Pressure on patients unethical</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that pressure on patients is not compatible with medical ethics. And that therefore doctors, according to their own self-image, should actually clearly distance themselves from the political vaccination campaign and its implementation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I314" spellcheck><h2>Nicht was Bill Gates will</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a successful strategy for getting through the crisis unscathed is clearly not to do everything that Bill Gates demands and recommends. And that in this way they have already come very far through the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="I315" spellcheck><h2>Why protein blueprint?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>why vaccinate a blueprint for a protein when you could also administer this protein directly? And even better dosed in the process?</span></p></a>
<a id="I316" spellcheck><h2>No correlation between vaccination rate and number of cases</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that no correlation could be established between the course of the vaccination campaigns or the vaccination rate and the development of corona diseases. And that the vaccination campaign cannot be a way out of the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I317" spellcheck><h2>sacking of nurses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that unvaccinated helpers and caregivers are being laid off from their jobs on a large scale worldwide in the direct and indirect areas of medical care for the population. And that this is completely counterproductive in the already tense situation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I318" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims are a taboo subject</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination victims, who exist in large numbers worldwide, are ignored and made taboo in the mass media. And that this manipulation is justified by not wanting to undermine or endanger the vaccination campaigns.</span></p></a>
<a id="I319" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims not caught up</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is no provision for catching vaccination victims as with other vaccinations. Instead, the victims themselves would be responsible for possible side effects, and the state and the manufacturer would be exempt from liability.</span></p></a>
<a id="I320" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims not taken seriously</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination victims all over the world have great difficulties in having the damage they have suffered taken seriously and associated with vaccination. And that damages are typically explained as coincidence by the majority of physicians, also in order to remove themselves from responsibility.</span></p></a>
<a id="I321" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality increasing with vaccination rate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide, as vaccination rates increase, excess mortality also increases, without these excess victims being explained as Corona deaths. And that the only explanation is that we are dealing with vaccination victims, which cannot be officially admitted.</span></p></a>
<a id="I322" spellcheck><h2>Gibraltar 100% vaccination rate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in Gibraltar almost all inhabitants are already fully vaccinated and that nevertheless with high incidence figures further drastic non-pharmaceutical measures are justified. And that this vaccination pioneer is already making it clear that vaccination will not be a way out of the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I323" spellcheck><h2>Hydroxychloroquin sabotaged</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in December 2020, the production facilities of the world's second largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine in Taoyuan City, Taiwan mysteriously exploded and burned down. And that this was another significant act in the suppression of drug covid therapies.</span></p></a>
<a id="I324" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine breakthroughs in severely ill patients</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is often stated that vaccine breakthroughs occur mainly in the severely ill, while at the same time it is precisely those who are to be protected with vaccination as a priority. And that this contradiction already makes it clear that vaccination does not provide a solution to the most important challenges.</span></p></a>
<a id="I325" spellcheck><h2>Symptomatic vaccinated statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the statistical data in everyday medical life on the burden of unvaccinated people are manipulated in such a way that vaccinated people who have contracted the virus are simply counted as unvaccinated. And that the proportion of the unvaccinated is thus deliberately falsified upwards....</span></p></a>
<a id="I326" spellcheck><h2>Unknown vaccination status statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the statistical data in everyday medical practice on the burden of unvaccinated people are manipulated in such a way that the vaccination status is often not recorded and later an unknown vaccination status is simply counted as unvaccinated. And that the proportion of the unvaccinated is thus deliberately falsified upwards.</span></p></a>
<a id="I327" spellcheck><h2>Burden due to unvaccinated proportion cumulative</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the statistical data in everyday medical life on the burden of unvaccinated people is manipulated in such a way that the ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated people is already cumulated since the start of the vaccination campaign. And that the proportion of the unvaccinated is thus deliberately distorted upwards.</span></p></a>
<a id="I328" spellcheck><h2>Symptomatic vaccinated statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the statistical data in everyday medical life on the burden of unvaccinated people are manipulated in such a way that vaccinated people who are ill with the virus are simply counted as unvaccinated. And that the number of unvaccinated is thus deliberately driven up.</span></p></a>
<a id="I329" spellcheck><h2>Milder courses of illness unproven effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the milder courses after vaccination are only an unsubstantiated statement for which there are no studies. And that therefore people who get vaccinated are misled by political propaganda.</span></p></a>
<a id="I330" spellcheck><h2>Practically no young people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that practically no healthy person under the age of 65 dies of corona without the most serious, relevant previous illnesses. And that the risk at a young age is so vanishingly small that almost all other risks in life outweigh it - including vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I331" spellcheck><h2>Uncertainty about long-term effects is enough</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that uncertainty about the long-term effects of vaccines is sufficient plausible justification for refusing vaccination. And that for this reason alone it is unacceptable to socially or even legally sanction people who decide differently about their bodies because of this uncertainty.</span></p></a>
<a id="I332" spellcheck><h2>Not for medical reasons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that many people get vaccinated for non-medical reasons such as travel and everyday convenience. And that exactly that is completely wrong and should never be the motivation for medical interventions.</span></p></a>
<a id="I333" spellcheck><h2>Understaffing due to exclusion of unvaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide in health care, nursing, police and fire departments the person-capacities are dramatically decreasing because employees were obliged to vaccinate and quit. And that the system is deliberately damaging itself here, causing its own failure.</span></p></a>
<a id="I334" spellcheck><h2>Streissand effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the demonization, censorship, and shutdown of alternative media outlets around the world is having an opposite effect through the Streissand effect. And that more and more people are thus becoming aware of the information that these measures are intended to suppress.</span></p></a>
<a id="I335" spellcheck><h2>Silence money for relatives</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the official number of vaccination victims is not only heavily distorted by the lack of reports in the relevant databases, but is also supported by hush money for the relatives of the victims. And that this is another reason why the number of victims is not reliable.</span></p></a>
<a id="I336" spellcheck><h2>Effective treatment protocols suppressed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are successful treatment protocols for the viral disease, but they are hardly used. And that the reasons for this are organized suppression by orders from above and by vituperative articles in the media.</span></p></a>
<a id="I337" spellcheck><h2>Signature for vaccination?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>whether you ever had to sign anything when you were vaccinated. And that after all, this assurance alone is an indication that there are risks associated with this treatment, where those responsible are trying to exempt themselves from liability.</span></p></a>
<a id="I338" spellcheck><h2>Studies not double blind</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the third-phase vaccine trials, which are being conducted in parallel with the global vaccine rollout by all manufacturers, are not properly double-blinded. And that these thus cannot deliver any meaningful results at all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I339" spellcheck><h2>Control group eliminated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in the vaccine studies of the third phase, which are carried out in parallel to the worldwide vaccine rollout by all manufacturers, the control group has been eliminated by vaccination offers long before their planned completion. And that these can therefore no longer deliver any meaningful results.</span></p></a>
<a id="I340" spellcheck><h2>Booster with the same vaccine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the so-called booster vaccinations are still carried out with the same vaccine, which is hardly effective any more, although, as with influenza, one would expect adjustments to new variants before the next vaccination campaign takes place.</span></p></a>
<a id="I341" spellcheck><h2>Variants usually more harmless</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the narrative with the regular new, more dangerous virus variants completely contradicts the experience that viruses generally become more harmless and less harmful in their mutations. And that viruses ensure their own &lsquo;survival&rsquo; through this property, among other things.</span></p></a>
<a id="I342" spellcheck><h2>Gene vaccination but no GMO food?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>why people do not want to eat genetically modified food and pay close attention to this as consumers, but have no problems with the medicinal transformation of their own body into a genetically modified organism. And that nevertheless in both cases with interferences into nature and unclear long-term consequences one argues.</span></p></a>
<a id="I343" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination regime puts convalescents in danger</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that pressure and compulsory vaccination worldwide put people who have already survived the virus infection in danger, as they could take unnecessary risks by vaccinating and even weaken their strong immune system again. And that these purely political interventions are not supported by medical reasons.</span></p></a>
<a id="I344" spellcheck><h2>Plato's Allegory of the Cave</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the world currently resembles, as in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, a shadowy land of dumbed-down slaves in a cave, controlled by elites via false narratives, who, however, only want their and our best interests, but may have done the math without the small, enlightened part of humanity...</span></p></a>
<a id="I345" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination rate unknown and politicized</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the vaccination rate is unknown worldwide due to a lack of appropriate tracking, but is always used by politicians as just needed. A high rate is reported as a sign of success, and the lowest possible rate is reported to animate the population to vaccinate.</span></p></a>
<a id="I346" spellcheck><h2>Sugar a cause of severe courses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that an important, little noticed cause of severe covid courses is an elevated blood glucose level. And that glucose management should therefore play a central role in the treatment of covid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I347" spellcheck><h2>You can't rely on medical care</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that medical care in case of covid disease cannot be relied upon worldwide, as various treatment protocols with proven evidence (e.g. Zelenko) are not followed and proven harmful therapies are not abandoned.</span></p></a>
<a id="I348" spellcheck><h2>Monoclonal antibodies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a therapy of the viral disease by monoclonal antibodies has proven to be very effective. And that this is a further indication that there have long been sufficient treatment options and that a general vaccination or even compulsory vaccination has no medical basis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I349" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated just as contagious</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that recent studies show that vaccinated people are not only similarly contagious due to the same viral load, but do so for the same length of time as unvaccinated people. And that due to this lack of difference there is no basis for unequal social treatment of both groups.</span></p></a>
<a id="I350" spellcheck><h2>Vulnerable largest vaccination victim group</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the elderly, the previously ill and the immunodeficient make up the lion's share of vaccination victims, although the self-imposed goal of vaccination was to protect precisely these people! And that this fact alone makes the whole campaign absurd.</span></p></a>
<a id="I351" spellcheck><h2>Young most unnecessary vaccination victim group</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that young people have an absolutely negligible risk of threatening corona disease. And that their vaccination is therefore inappropriate and exposes them to a completely unnecessary, many times higher risk of vaccine side effects and death.</span></p></a>
<a id="I352" spellcheck><h2>Proper research stupid?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>whether it's not completely irrational to consider people who do extensive research before buying a house or a car as smart, but those who do so before an experimental injection as stupid?</span></p></a>
<a id="I353" spellcheck><h2>No appropriate data on the pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that even so long after the pandemic began, neither appropriate metrics nor clean data are being collected to assess it. And that this is an indication that policy must be concerned with concerns other than public health.</span></p></a>
<a id="I354" spellcheck><h2>Incidences still unsuitable data</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that incidence as a pandemic indicator has long been recognized as unsuitable and manipulable and is nevertheless still used worldwide as the gold standard. And that this shows that crisis management at this level is not being pursued with any serious scientific ambition.</span></p></a>
<a id="I355" spellcheck><h2>No interest in clean data</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that politicians worldwide seem to have no interest at all in reliable and valid data for assessing the pandemic, its risks and the effectiveness and usefulness of prescribed measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I356" spellcheck><h2>Secrecy of Pfizer studies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in the USA the drug authorities are working with Pfizer to keep the data from the approval studies secret from the public for decades. And that this alone is enough of an indication that we are not dealing with righteous, trustworthy actors.</span></p></a>
<a id="I357" spellcheck><h2>Increased pulse rate and blood pressure</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are innumerable reports, in particular of sporty active vaccinated people, about a permanently strongly increased pulse rate and also blood pressure after their vaccination. And that this points to possibly irreparable damage to their cardiovascular system!</span></p></a>
<a id="I358" spellcheck><h2>Mengele would be proud</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the doctor Joseph Mengele would be proud to learn how, 90 years after the horror of mass medical experimentation in Nazi Germany, the majority of doctors were once again participating in such. And all the more so if he were to learn that this has now been achieved worldwide.</span></p></a>
<a id="I359" spellcheck><h2>Increase in miscarriages and stillbirths</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there has been a significant increase in miscarriages and stillbirths worldwide since the start of vaccination. And that these figures should have raised the alarm long ago and brought the current vaccination practice to the test stand!</span></p></a>
<a id="I360" spellcheck><h2>80% useless eaters</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that globalised capitalism, with its ever increasing automation, has no further use for 80% of the people. And since they continue to consume scarce resources, it is only understandable that certain elite circles strive for a massive population reduction via the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I361" spellcheck><h2>Poorer care for the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide the gradual exclusion of the unvaccinated not only from social life but also from timely and adequate medical care can be observed. And that this development of discrimination is due to corresponding propaganda and media agitation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I362" spellcheck><h2>Brings out old ailments again</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the vaccination has been shown to cause many vaccinated people to experience an increased return of previous illnesses and of things that were thought to have been overcome, such as cancer, shingles and nervous disorders. And that this is a clear indication of still unrecognized harmful properties!</span></p></a>
<a id="I363" spellcheck><h2>Graphene hydroxide</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is evidence that the vaccines contain undeclared graphene hydroxide compounds which, when they enter the bloodstream of the vaccinated person, act like razor blades and gradually damage his blood vessels more and more. And that this process is accelerated at faster flow rates - something like exercise!</span></p></a>
<a id="I364" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination over-achievers increase rate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are many people who, out of excessive concern, get vaccinated more often than recommended, showing up for their &lsquo;first vaccination&rsquo; more often than they should with an empty vaccination book. And that these in these vaccinations distort the statistics in the direction of a higher general vaccination rate.</span></p></a>
<a id="I365" spellcheck><h2>Protect the protected from the unprotected</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the logic of the progressing vaccination campaign seems to be that the protected must be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that already doesn't work on the protected....</span></p></a>
<a id="I366" spellcheck><h2>Aspiration waived</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide, on the recommendation of the relevant bodies, the so-called aspiration is dispensed with for the Corona vaccination, which would help to exclude an intravascular injection, i.e. into the bloodstream. And that it is incomprehensible that such a simple and safe procedure is dispensed with.</span></p></a>
<a id="I367" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination in the bloodstream dangerous</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are many indications that vaccination produces increased harmful side effects, especially when the injection is intravascular, i.e., partially enters the bloodstream. And that this finding alone should lead to changes.</span></p></a>
<a id="I368" spellcheck><h2>Few particularly harmful batches</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that investigations by the U.S. adverse event database VAERS have shown that there is a small proportion of batches in all vaccines that are orders of magnitude more harmful or lethal. And that this observation alone should lead to a worldwide halt in vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="I369" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines only with exemption from liability</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccine manufacturers protect themselves from any liability in any country worldwide before vaccine is made available to nationals. And that this is also evident, for example, in the vaccination of refugees.</span></p></a>
<a id="I370" spellcheck><h2>Marx's Bold Capital</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the actions of the pharmaceutical industry in the crisis can be explained with Karl Marx: &lsquo;With a corresponding profit, capital becomes bold. 10% safe, and it can be applied anywhere; 20%, it becomes lively; 50%, positively reckless; for 100% it tramples all human laws under its foot; 300%, and no crime exists which it does not risk, even at the risk of the gallows...&rsquo;</span></p></a>
<a id="I371" spellcheck><h2>Ivermectin successful in Japan</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the preparation ivermectin has not only proven effective against covid in countless studies, but now also in practice. And that in certain parts of India the whole thing has already led to the permanent containment of the disease.</span></p></a>
<a id="I372" spellcheck><h2>Book &lsquo;The Real Anthony Fauci&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the new Kennedy book &lsquo;The Real Anthony Fauci&rsquo; exposes Fauci as a decades-long active mastermind in civil service for the unscrupulous enforcement of pharma interests by means of artificial threat scenarios. And that he also had and has a decisive influence in the so-called Corona crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I373" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated blamed for ineffectiveness?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that this is the first time in history that the failure of a medication to work is being blamed on those who have not taken it. And that one would not demand that others apply suntan lotion so that one does not get sunburned oneself.</span></p></a>
<a id="I374" spellcheck><h2>Skip first three vaccinations?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>whether they can skip the first three vaccinations and the fourth will work, or whether they have to take the first three that don't work in order for the fourth to work?</span></p></a>
<a id="I375" spellcheck><h2>Clearly a mass psychosis</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corona crisis resembles a mass psychosis in which a large part loses touch with reality and sinks into delusions. And that these are skillfully stoked so that the individual voluntarily gives up his rights and needs in blind obedience.</span></p></a>
<a id="I376" spellcheck><h2>Doctors used to be more cautious about vaccinations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that doctors used to be much more cautious about vaccinations, especially for pregnant women. And that despite the relatively very high rate of side effects, there is no longer any evidence of this caution.</span></p></a>
<a id="I377" spellcheck><h2>Early treatment systematically blocked</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Covid early treatment solutions have been systematically blocked in order to protect the vaccine market. And that this practice has also massively increased the number of victims and is tantamount to organised murder.</span></p></a>
<a id="I378" spellcheck><h2>Natural immunity much more effective</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that natural immunity to the Corona virus is many times more effective than vaccine-induced immunity. And that it is therefore counterproductive to prescribe it for everyone with a healthy immune system.</span></p></a>
<a id="I379" spellcheck><h2>Evolution of viruses into less dangerous</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, as with all other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also obeys the laws of evolution and becomes more and more infectious but also less and less dangerous. And that, without human intervention, the variant that spreads most easily will prevail.</span></p></a>
<a id="I380" spellcheck><h2>It only ends when we end it</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the alleged Corona crisis will only end if the majority consciously allows it to end.

<a id="I381" spellcheck><h2>Health insurance covers everybody</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the solidarity-based pay-as-you-go system of health insurance is calculated for all risky lifestyles, including riding motorcycles, smoking and eating bad food.

<a id="I382" spellcheck><h2>Red hand letters of the manufacturers</h2>

<a id="I383" spellcheck><h2>Nano-lipids for research purposes only</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the nano-lipids used in all mRNA vaccines for encapsulation may only be used for research purposes according to their manufacturers.

<a id="I384" spellcheck><h2>No proof of effectiveness of vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is still no reliable scientific proof that vaccinations work and save lives. And that this claim is nevertheless regularly made by politicians, doctors and the media, thereby misleading people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I385" spellcheck><h2>Much evidence for the harmfulness of vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, on the other hand, there is a lot of scientific evidence of the harmfulness of vaccination and that the risk of dying from vaccination is tens of times higher than dying from the disease.

<a id="I386" spellcheck><h2>Many more athletes collapse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the number of athletes who develop health problems, collapse during sport and also die has increased dramatically since the global vaccination campaign began.

<a id="I387" spellcheck><h2>Empty social coffers relieved by vaccination victims</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that death by vaccination, especially among the elderly, is accepted or even wanted by politicians in order to relieve the empty pension and retirement funds.

<a id="I389" spellcheck><h2>Science vs. scientists</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that &lsquo;trust the science&rsquo; should never be confused with &lsquo;trust the scientist&rsquo;. Because science is objective and factual, while scientists can sell themselves to the highest bidder.</span></p></a>
<a id="I390" spellcheck><h2>Lancet gate shows foul play</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Lancet study on the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, which was later withdrawn, shows how science is misused for vested interests.

<a id="I393" spellcheck><h2>Fear feeds Corona</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it has been proven that anxiety disorders are among the strongest risk factors for a severe covid disease.

<a id="I394" spellcheck><h2>Blood coagulation disorders / D-dimers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the blood coagulation is worsened after vaccination in a large number of vaccinated persons. And that this effect can also be determined with a so-called coagulation laboratory via the D-dimers.</span></p></a>
<a id="I395" spellcheck><h2>Politician Theatre Everywhere</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide politicians and officials are convicted by photo and video recordings of the Corona Theater. And that if the politicians do not take seriously their self-imposed measures on distance and masks, how it should the population?</span></p></a>
<a id="I396" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not reach the mucous membranes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the best place to strengthen the immune system against resiratory viruses are the mucous membranes. And that the Corona vaccinations, unfortunately, only have their effect in other parts of the body.</span></p></a>
<a id="I397" spellcheck><h2>EU 4.4 billion cans pre-ordered</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the EU has already pre-ordered vaccines in quantities that would be sufficient for all EU citizens for many years. And that this is a clear indication that this is a long-term 'programme' which has nothing to do with a pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="I398" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theory vs. reality?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>what is the difference between conspiracy theory and reality in Corona times? And that the answer must be more and more often &lsquo;only a few months&rsquo;, for example in the case of child vaccination, compulsory vaccination, quarantine camps, segregation and vaccination subscription.</span></p></a>
<a id="I399" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine breakthrough = not working</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the term vaccine breakthrough is just a friendly euphemism for the fact that the vaccines simply do not work. And that this is another example of linguistic manipulation or neologism.</span></p></a>
<a id="I400" spellcheck><h2>Pharma companies worse than the Mafia</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the big pharmaceutical companies have a long, quasi-mafia history of human experimentation and fraud, which only remained without consequences through lobbying and billions in payments.

<a id="I401" spellcheck><h2>Quarantine camp already prepared</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that quarantine camps are being set up on a large scale in many countries around the world, and that they are already being used in Australia, for example.

<a id="I402" spellcheck><h2>Definition vaccine changed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the pharmaceutical manufacturers have succeeded in officially watering down the concept of a vaccine to such an extent that it no longer has to provide any kind of immunity.

<a id="I403" spellcheck><h2>Term Vaccine redefined</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the CDC has unceremoniously withdrawn the PCR test process as a valid method for detecting Sars-Cov-2 for the start of the year 2022.

<a id="I405" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated pilots particularly at risk</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that pilots are already exposed to increased risks of thrombosis and infarction under normal circumstances due to their working environment. However, this risk is increased even further in the case of Corona-vaccinated pilots, which is already reflected in the correspondingly increased number of victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="I406" spellcheck><h2>Nano lipids produce inflammation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it has now been scientifically proven that, in addition to the spike proteins, the nano-lipids with which the mRNA in the vaccines is coated also trigger life-threatening inflammations in the body. And that with this knowledge, the vaccines must be withdrawn from circulation as quickly as possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I407" spellcheck><h2>Nano-lipids not approved for humans</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the mRNA vaccines should never have been approved due to their ingredients, as the lipids used are only allowed to be used for research purposes according to the manufacturer.

<a id="I408" spellcheck><h2>Inappropriate police violence at demos</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that inappropriate police violence, intended to deter and appearing politically motivated, is occurring at demonstrations of critics of Corona's policies around the world.

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Dr. Robert Malone, as one of the co-inventors of mRNA technology, has taken a critical stance on vaccinations and is now being massively censored and defamed via the tech corporations.

<a id="I410" spellcheck><h2>Singing allowed, dancing forbidden?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the absurdity and obvious ineffectiveness of most of the measures imposed around the world must be obvious to any sensible person. And that the many interest-driven exceptions alone are treacherous.</span></p></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the scientific situation on most questions about Corona is by no means as clear as the mass media and selected government advisors make it out to be. And that the scientific discourse is still in full swing.</span></p></a>
<a id="I412" spellcheck><h2>The wrath of the vaccinated will come</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that when the crisis is over, politicians and experts will be met with the wrath of those who have been vaccinated. And that they will attribute their own suffering directly to the pressure to vaccinate them.</span></p></a>
<a id="I413" spellcheck><h2>Over when we stop participating</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the two camps fighting each other will never end the crisis. And that, on the other hand, this is over immediately when the majority stops participating in the prescribed measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I414" spellcheck><h2>The 14 days are the trick</h2>

<a id="I415" spellcheck><h2>Anti-protest ordinances everywhere</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a pattern can be seen worldwide in which the legal freedom of assembly is undermined by regulations and police violence. And that in this way the resistance against the Corona regime should be suppressed.</span></p></a>
<a id="I416" spellcheck><h2>Telegram is democracy in action</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that while Telegram is used for a lot of bad things, it's important to the democratic opposition around the world. And that it guarantees the freedom of expression that we cannot do without.</span></p></a>
<a id="I417" spellcheck><h2> Life insurance companies refuse payment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that more and more cases are becoming known in which life insurance companies refuse to pay out after a vaccine death. And that they justify it by saying that it was an experimental, non-state-mandated treatment.</span></p></a>
<a id="I418" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinations more Covid!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it has long been statistically proven that the number of Covid cases worldwide is increasing as the vaccination rate increases! And that the vaccination produces the disease and thus extends the state of emergency indefinitely.</span></p></a>
<a id="I419" spellcheck><h2>Only believed promises</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the majority of those who have been vaccinated merely believed the promises of freedom made by politicians or bowed to the pressure. And that none of them acted out of conviction but in the hope of an end to the measures.</span></p></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that we have a real pandemic and that the vaccine would work, that vaccines can be bought on the black market instead of fake vaccination cards. And that this circumstance shows what people are really afraid of.</span></p></a>
<a id="I421" spellcheck><h2>Like mafia protection money</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that anyone who claims that those who are participating in the Corona measures can be counted as supporters probably also means that those who pay protection money extorted from the mafia welcome their protective measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="I422" spellcheck><h2>Don't Look Up</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the film &lsquo;Don't Look Up&rsquo; is an artistic parable of the current corona situation, in which we are all so manipulated that we choose our fate voluntarily into the hands of unscrupulous interest groups. And that in the end we too will pay the price.</span></p></a>
<a id="I423" spellcheck><h2>Treatment protocols kill</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that despite much evidence about appropriate treatment methods worldwide, many physicians still follow treatment protocols for covid patients that harm them. And that, as a result, this is still responsible for a significant proportion of covid victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="I424" spellcheck><h2>From clapping to sacking</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the same health care workers who not long ago were publicly applauded for their efforts during the crisis can now expect to be fired in part because of their vaccination status. </span></p></a>
<a id="I425" spellcheck><h2>Stockholm Syndrome</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the blind obedience and unshakable trust of the global majority of the population in the repressive strategies and measures for crisis management can no longer be regarded as anything other than Stockholm syndrome.</span></p></a>
<a id="I426" spellcheck><h2>Deliberate destruction</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the measures of politics worldwide, for example the dismissal of nurses, police and truck drivers because of their vaccination status is tantamount to a destruction of functioning social structures. And that this is obviously being done with a seeing eye and thus intentionally and with malicious intent.</span></p></a>
<a id="I427" spellcheck><h2>Authorities threaten doctors</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that health authorities threaten and blackmail physicians not to grant exemptions for masks or vaccinations, thus inadmissibly interfering with physicians' freedom of treatment. And that this pressure clearly cannot serve general health.</span></p></a>
<a id="I428" spellcheck><h2>My freedom and your fear</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that their freedom does not end where the fear of others begins. And that the issue here is not that different freedoms are opposed to each other, but different perceptions of risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="I429" spellcheck><h2>Conflicts of interest</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a large proportion of the key politicians, scientists, officials and media driving the corona action and vaccination agenda worldwide have demonstrable conflicts of interest. And that this can usually be demonstrated through links to the pharmaceutical industry, such as payments.</span></p></a>
<a id="I430" spellcheck><h2>Boosters further weakens immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that studies now show that every further Corona vaccination further weakens the immune system of the vaccinated. And that this weakening is caused, among other things, by the fact that the own defense is blocked with the ingredients of the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I431" spellcheck><h2>Disease strengthens immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the well-known wisdom still holds true that having been through an illness strengthens the immune system. And that this kind of immunization is even the most effective and long lasting.</span></p></a>
<a id="I432" spellcheck><h2>Coronaviruses mutate too much</h2>

<a id="I433" spellcheck><h2>How many boosters are you still taking?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>how many booster vaccinations / boosters one still wants to be administered before quitting the vaccination madness? And that this loop has an individual end for everyone anyway: With the first severe side effect or death.</span></p></a>
<a id="I434" spellcheck><h2>Only Gauls left</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that governments worldwide have set themselves an unattainable goal with their vaccination quotas, since the remaining vaccination unwilling are conviction offenders. And that one can compare them with the indomitable Gauls in Asterix.</span></p></a>
<a id="I435" spellcheck><h2>Demonstrate for you with</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they will demonstrate on behalf of those who are still clinging to the official announcements and narratives and hoping for a regular end to the crisis. And that in the end, however, they will all take to the streets.</span></p></a>
<a id="I436" spellcheck><h2>Already write will</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that those who want to continue with every booster vaccination should already write their will. Because as in Russian roulette, one of these vaccinations will inevitably mean their end.</span></p></a>
<a id="I437" spellcheck><h2>The microbe is nothing, the environment is everything</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Antoine Béchamp's insight, according to which the condition of the host is primarily responsible for the development of disease, still holds true. And that even his adversary Pasteur had to prove him right in the end.</span></p></a>
<a id="I438" spellcheck><h2>More and more vaccinated people regret the injection</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that more and more vaccinated people regret their vaccination, because they realize that on the one hand it has rather harmed their body and on the other hand it is demanded from them again and again. And that the repentant will bring this policy down in the end.</span></p></a>
<a id="I439" spellcheck><h2>MIS/PIMS through vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination triggers multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS or PIMS) in the body of many vaccinees, especially children. And that this effect of vaccination, like other side effects, are falsely attributed to the disease Covid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I440" spellcheck><h2>Moving Goalposts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the beginning of the pandemic, politicians have changed the goals of their measures countless times, often without scientific evidence, such as the vaccination rate to be achieved. And that they obviously want to keep the state of emergency longer!</span></p></a>
<a id="I441" spellcheck><h2>Radiation interacts with the vaccine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that graphene oxide as a superconductor in the body of vaccinated people reacts to radiation and produces damage in the body through vibrations. And that vaccinated people are therefore in mortal danger in the vicinity of e.g. radio transmission masts.</span></p></a>
<a id="I442" spellcheck><h2>Should do AIDS test</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that those who have had the 3rd dose should go to a laboratory and take an AIDS test. And that the result may surprise you.</span></p></a>
<a id="I443" spellcheck><h2>Censorship prevents informed consent</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the informed consent of the patient, which is obligatory for medical treatments, is made impossible by massive censorship in connection with vaccination. And that this is a gigantic crime against humanity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I444" spellcheck><h2>Nanotech in vaccine</h2>

<a id="I445" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine leads to VAIDS</h2>

<a id="I446" spellcheck><h2>They don't give up the reins</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the conspirators in the background, who have elaborately prepared the crisis in order to push through their interests, will certainly not be impressed by the resistance. And that they can still play out many options to continue the global state of emergency.</span></p></a>
<a id="I447" spellcheck><h2>False vaccination certificates show defense</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the high number of falsified vaccination certificates shows that in real terms many people do not allow themselves to be forced to be vaccinated. And that the statistical deviations indicate a large invisible resistance.</span></p></a>
<a id="I448" spellcheck><h2>Always new explanations for side effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that currently in the media the craziest explanations for heart problems and infarctions are circulating. And that the only explanation you never read is the most obvious one: that they are foldal side effects of vaccination!</span></p></a>
<a id="I449" spellcheck><h2>DNA fingerprints are stored</h2>

<a id="I453" spellcheck><h2>Random testing too error-prone</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that regular testing without any reason, for example in schools, cannot be a sensible measure in view of the error rates. And that, on the contrary, this approach only ensures that people constantly become problem cases unnecessarily and unjustifiably.</span></p></a>
<a id="I454" spellcheck><h2>Postponed is not canceled</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that although governments around the world are repeatedly comprehensively withdrawing previously enacted regulations and measures, this is always done only for a limited period of time.

<a id="I456" spellcheck><h2>Want my friends and helpers back</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they want their police to regain the self-image of being a friend and helper from before the crisis. And that it cannot be that the police are misused for the implementation of state interests instead of those of the citizens.</span></p></a>
<a id="I457" spellcheck><h2>Fearful faction radicalized</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that social factions with the most pronounced fears are becoming increasingly radicalized precisely through demands for the most repressive measures and punishments. And that these are usually given uncritical space in the mass media.</span></p></a>

<a id="I459" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is like Russian roulette</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there are obviously different problematic batches and, moreover, that the vaccine can enter the bloodstream without aspiration. And that one can therefore justifiably speak of a Russian roulette.</span></p></a>
<a id="I460" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination risks increase with each booster</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that each additional Corona vaccination further increases the risk of severe side effects or even death for those vaccinated.

<a id="I464" spellcheck><h2>Journalistic standards not met</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that journalists (not only) have regularly violated journalistic standards since the beginning of the Corona crisis. And that these media representatives are thereby jointly responsible for the development, among other things also for the social division.</span></p></a>
<a id="I465" spellcheck><h2>Childhood Immunization Has Hidden Agenda</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the high pressure with which the vaccine manufacturers are pushing the vaccination of children has primarily a regulatory cause: Depending on the country, manufacturers are exempt from liability precisely when their vaccine is also recommended for children.</span></p></a>
<a id="I466" spellcheck><h2>Titanium dioxide in masks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that especially white masks are coated with the toxic substance titanium dioxide for whitening. And that masks have been partially withdrawn, but still enough harmful masks are sold and in circulation.</span></p></a>
<a id="I467" spellcheck><h2>General failure of the left</h2>

<a id="I470" spellcheck><h2>Protesters from the bourgeois spectrum</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that participants in Corona protests are often portrayed in the media as violent extremists, but in reality they come mainly from the middle-class spectrum. And that this classification serves primarily to exclude.</span></p></a>
<a id="I471" spellcheck><h2>Agent Provocateurs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that agents provocateurs smuggled in by the authorities repeatedly cause disturbances at Corona protests, which then justify police interventions. And that the protests are thus falsely framed in the media as violent and aggressive.</span></p></a>
<a id="I472" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinations are big business</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinations, both in general and in the specific Corona context, are first and foremost big business for physicians. And that pediatricians in particular often generate much of their income from these treatments.</span></p></a>

<a id="I477" spellcheck><h2>Corona policy belongs in court</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Corona policy and measures in almost all countries of the world were hardly evidence-based and at the same time violated human rights. And that the responsible politicians therefore belong before a court.</span></p></a>

<a id="I481" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory vaccination is for vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a general vaccination obligation is sold as being directed against the unvaccinated, but in reality it is there to force those who have already been vaccinated into permanent treatment.

<a id="I482" spellcheck><h2>Children long since &lsquo;contaminated&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that data worldwide show that children have long had strong natural immunity. And that therefore neither the enforcement of strict rules nor that of childhood vaccination is medically indicated.</span></p></a>
<a id="I483" spellcheck><h2>Coercion of children to vaccinate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that governments around the world are using regulations and campaigns to coerce immature children into harming themselves through vaccination.

<a id="I485" spellcheck><h2>Ukraine war serves as a distraction</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that during the Ukraine war, vaccination obligations and uniform vaccination certificates are being implemented worldwide without much fuss. And that the war distracts people from the fact that a global hygiene totalitarianism is being installed.</span></p></a>
<a id="I486" spellcheck><h2>Freedom is not an encore</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that freedom in democratic societies is not a generously granted addition or cherry on the cake, but a principle that must always apply, no matter how great the danger.</span></p></a>
<a id="I487" spellcheck><h2>Side effects not a sign of efficacy</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that symptoms such as fever, headache or vomiting are a sign of the desired immune response is completely false. And that this myth is disproved by BioNTech/Pfizer's Phase 1 results.</span></p></a>

<a id="I489" spellcheck><h2>Covid already proven before 2020</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that studies demonstrate the virus, as well as antibodies to it, for samples from long before the official outbreak. And that these facts alone disprove the Wuhan story as the starting point of the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I490" spellcheck><h2>No-Covid Self-Destructive Ideology</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the idea that the spread of the virus can be prevented by rigorous measures against one's own population is an unscientific and self-destructive ideology. And that it must be urgently stopped.</span></p></a>

<a id="I493" spellcheck><h2>Developmental disorders in children</h2>

And that there are sometimes only limited time windows available for certain developmental steps.</span></p></a>
<a id="I494" spellcheck><h2>Increasingly anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the danger of the virus, which is communicated through all channels, is causing both children and adults to develop anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders more and more frequently. And the resulting social damage is hardly recorded.</span></p></a>
<a id="I495" spellcheck><h2>mRNA modifies own DNA</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it has now been proven that the mRNA introduced into the human body by vaccination directly alters the body's own DNA. And that one can therefore firmly assume unforeseeable long-term consequences.</span></p></a>
<a id="I496" spellcheck><h2>Chomsky's Narrowed Corridor of Opinion</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that an extremely narrow, in part existence-threatening corridor of opinion has been established everywhere around the criticism of measures and vaccination. And that in the meantime even Chomsky himself is affected by this phenomenon described by him.</span></p></a>
<a id="I497" spellcheck><h2>Doctors no longer know what to do</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they hear more and more frequently that doctors are at a loss when it comes to patients' health problems, or that they can't find a cause. And that they typically do not want to see the actual cause: The Vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I498" spellcheck><h2>Records declassified</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA) had to release the approval documents for the Pfizer vaccine after a successful lawsuit. And that the FDA had previously wanted to withhold the documents for decades.</span></p></a>
<a id="I499" spellcheck><h2>9 pages side effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the Pfizer vaccine's marketing authorization documents, which have been released, contain, among other things, 9 small-print pages with frequent - over 2% - side effects. And that these show that the manufacturer knew of the danger based on his studies.</span></p></a>
<a id="I500" spellcheck><h2>500 million people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that elitist eugenicist circles have already made clear via the Georgia Guidestones how they want to &lsquo;save the world&rsquo;. And that one of the core goals is the reduction of the world population to 500 million people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I501" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination premeditated mass murder</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the serious side effects were known in detail to both Pfizer and the FDA before the vaccine was introduced. And that the implementation of the vaccination therefore amounts to deliberate mass murder, crimes against humanity and genocide.</span></p></a>
<a id="I502" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination certificates switched off at the touch of a button</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that even those who rely on their digital vaccination certificates for further participation in society are not safe from arbitrary action by the state. More and more countries are forcing their citizens to undergo further vaccinations by making these certificates invalid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I503" spellcheck><h2>mRNA technology choice &lsquo;counterintuitive&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Pfizer CEO Bourla stated in an interview that the decision to go with mRNA vaccine technology was &lsquo;counterintuitive&rsquo; because there was the least experience with it. And that he himself was very surprised by this path.</span></p></a>
<a id="I504" spellcheck><h2>Weak immune system Vaccinated danger for all</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that because the immune system of vaccinated people is much weaker, viruses of all kinds can circulate more easily overall. And that this can also become a problem for the unvaccinated, regardless of Corona.</span></p></a>
<a id="I505" spellcheck><h2>Accelerated aging process in vaccinated individuals</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the bodies of vaccinated people experience accelerated aging because the genetic repair mechanism is destroyed by the vaccination. And that we will have statistical certainty about this monstrosity in a few years.</span></p></a>
<a id="I506" spellcheck><h2>Do you know what's in the vaccine?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>whether it was even known what was in the vaccines. And that no one who had been honestly informed about the ingredients would have opted for a vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I507" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people have a much higher viral load</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinated patients have an average viral load that is hundreds of times higher than that of unvaccinated patients. And that, contrary to what is claimed, they are therefore a much greater risk of infection for their fellow human beings than the unvaccinated.</span></p></a>
<a id="I508" spellcheck><h2>Thinking about illness makes you sick</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that whoever constantly worries about illness will also become ill in the end. And that the media emphasis on Corona has turned many people into hypochondriacs who now live with a constant fear for their health.</span></p></a>
<a id="I509" spellcheck><h2>What about Shanghai?</h2>

<a id="I510" spellcheck><h2>Medicine corrupted by interests</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that evidence-based medicine has been so corrupted by corporate interests, failed regulation, and the commercialization of academia that it can no longer be trusted. And that the Corona crisis has made this fact visible to all.</span></p></a>
<a id="I511" spellcheck><h2>Microplastics from masks in the lungs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that microplastic particles from masks have already been found in the lung tissue of many people during operations. And that more and more new damages become public, which you can inflict on your body by wearing masks all the time.</span></p></a>
<a id="I512" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination side effects are trivialized</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a societal aberration has established itself worldwide, in which drastic vaccination side effects are ignored or trivialized. And that we have come a long way from responsible behavior to a gigantic self-deception.</span></p></a>
<a id="I513" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated pilots are a safety risk</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that pilots who have been forced by their airlines to be vaccinated suffer more frequently from heart problems or even have heart attacks in the cockpit. And that they have thus become a safety risk for passengers and unfit for their job.</span></p></a>
<a id="I514" spellcheck><h2>Pfizer's side effects task force</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Pfizer received so many adverse event reports during its pivotal trial that it had to hire thousands of additional employees to process them. And that alone shows how irresponsible the emergency approval was.</span></p></a>
<a id="I515" spellcheck><h2>Hariri reveals surveillance agenda</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that historian and author Yuval Noah Harari regularly reveals in interviews where the Corona Crisis is leading people: to the acceptance and legitimization of total biometric surveillance.

<a id="I516" spellcheck><h2>Schwab Bond villain made real</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the WEF boss Klaus Schwab appears and speaks like a real Bond villain. And that the megalomania that becomes apparent in connection with the real influence of his comrades-in-arms on our future must worry every sensible person.</span></p></a>
<a id="I517" spellcheck><h2>Doctors cannot admit to vaccine damage</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that physicians who administer vaccinations cannot admit to vaccination side effects and deaths because otherwise they would be directly responsible and could be held liable. And that this looking away, however, violates all medical principles.</span></p></a>
<a id="I518" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines are not regularly licensed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that in the meantime it has become clear that the Corona vaccines will never receive regular approval, but will nevertheless continue to be administered on a mandatory basis via emergency regulations. And that for this worldwide in criminal way protective mechanisms were undermined.</span></p></a>
<a id="I519" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theorist now honorary title</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the pejorative label of &lsquo;conspiracy theorist&rsquo; for critical people turns more into a &lsquo;medal of honor&rsquo; with every prediction that comes true. And that apologies on a personal, political and media level are overdue worldwide.</span></p></a>
<a id="I520" spellcheck><h2>Booster ineffective due to antigenic original sin</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that due to the so-called &lsquo;antigenic original sin&rsquo; only more antibodies against the original version of the coronavirus are produced, even if an omicron booster is vaccinated. And that therefore &lsquo;adapted&rsquo; vaccines hardly achieve better protective effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="I521" spellcheck><h2>Mask marks subordinates</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that if in the travel, culture and gastronomy sector only employees have to wear masks, but the guests do not, it looks like a subjugation for them. And that one has arrived with it already again at feudalism and class society.</span></p></a>
<a id="I522" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination are already reversed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that attempts are now being made to medically reverse some of the harmful effects of vaccinations. And that a successful procedure for this is the so-called blood washing or transfusion.</span></p></a>
<a id="I523" spellcheck><h2>Lack of admission limits legal recourse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that large parts of the world's population have been persuaded or coerced into vaccination but have limited legal options as victims because of the emergency approval. And that the state typically only steps in with a regular approval.</span></p></a>
<a id="I524" spellcheck><h2>Use dirty masks is useless</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that wearing the same mask for weeks/months against the specification and kept in your pocket is pointless and dangerous. And that you constantly inhale fungi, bacteria and harmful, detaching plastic fibers.</span></p></a>
<a id="I525" spellcheck><h2>Masks make sailor ears</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the constant wearing of masks leads not only to pain in the ears but also gradually to unaesthetic protruding sail ears. And that you would have to pull back the ears over the same duration to prevent this.</span></p></a>
<a id="I526" spellcheck><h2>Professional protective masks only with instructions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that professional protective masks in particular (FFP2/3, N95) can only be worn sensibly at all after expert instruction and guidance. And that you can clearly see in everyday life that this does not happen anywhere.</span></p></a>
<a id="I527" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory disclosure for politicians!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that before politicians and experts make policy in the Corona context, they would first have to rule out any proximity or dependence on the pharmaceutical industry. And that this is the only way to ensure that they also make decisions in the interests of the citizens.</span></p></a>
<a id="I528" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people start to hate unvaccinated people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinated people start to hate unvaccinated people because of their problems, because of their health, and because of their defensiveness, which now turns out to be correct. And that they are not good decision makers in politics and business because of these emotions.</span></p></a>
<a id="I529" spellcheck><h2>Origin vaccine ineffective</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccine doses are still being stored and used that were developed against the original alpha variant. And that vaccination with these against the current variants is about as effective as Windows 95 virus protection on a Mac computer.</span></p></a>
<a id="I530" spellcheck><h2>Global increase in hepatitis</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that there is an increasing number of hepatitis cases worldwide, which often necessitate liver transplants or are even fatal. And that the cause is weakened immune systems of those affected, for example because of reduced contacts or - the vaccination!</span></p></a>
<a id="I531" spellcheck><h2>Discreet hearse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that increasingly discreet hearses, no longer recognizable as such, are being used to pick up people who are dying more and more frequently in everyday life. And that this is done in order not to further unsettle people.</span></p></a>
<a id="I532" spellcheck><h2>Masks make covid worse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the use of masks has been proven to aggravate a (later) covid disease, as they weaken the body and the immune system and damage the lungs, for example through fungi and germs. And that a mask obligation is thus even counterproductive.</span></p></a>
<a id="I533" spellcheck><h2>No compensation for relatives</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that relatives and surviving dependents of vaccination victims or deaths are generally not compensated because of major bureaucratic hurdles. One of the reasons for this is that no one in the system is interested in making the cases visible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I534" spellcheck><h2>Herd immunity only in the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that lasting immunity only develops in unvaccinated persons who have fallen ill, and thus only they contribute to herd immunity. And that vaccinated persons, on the other hand, are permanently dependent on boosters to maintain their immunity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I535" spellcheck><h2>Only your own immune system counts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the chances of surviving an infection well in general depend practically only on the condition of one's own immune system. And that one should therefore invest the most energy in improving it, for example through vitamins and minerals.</span></p></a>
<a id="I536" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated smell unpleasant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they can recognize inoculated persons by partly unpleasant exhalations, which are sweetish and/or remind of evaporating meat. And that this could indicate that internal decomposition processes have already begun in these.</span></p></a>
<a id="I537" spellcheck><h2>Media act undemocratically</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the media are not fulfilling their duty to maintain journalistic balance due to one-sided reporting and omissions. And that they are thus weakening the principle of self-regulation and putting our democratic system at risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="I538" spellcheck><h2>Equivalent hijacked plane</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that because vaccination also involves sacrifice, it is an equivalent to the moral dilemma of wanting to shoot down a hijacked airplane to prevent an attack. And that the case law here is clearly positioned against it.</span></p></a>
<a id="I539" spellcheck><h2>No resources for adverse event reporting</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that physicians and hospitals do not have any free resources for the submission of reports on vaccination side effects and that such a report is of course not remunerated. This is also the reason why there is a massive under-reporting.</span></p></a>
<a id="I540" spellcheck><h2>If it goes wrong you have only yourself to blame</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is particularly perfidious that vaccination victims worldwide are themselves blamed for their fate with reference to their signature. And that after people have been driven into vaccination by state-organized regulations and coercion.</span></p></a>
<a id="I541" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine damage interpreted as long covid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that people who follow the official narrative tend to interpret their own or others' vaccine harms as long covid effects. And that, unfortunately, they also tend to undergo further harmful vaccinations as a result.</span></p></a>
<a id="I542" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous rebreathing with masks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the prolonged wearing of masks leads to a problematic rebreathing of CO2, which is far above occupational health and safety limits and leads to health/cognitive impairments. And that this is especially true for children!</span></p></a>
<a id="I543" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated have a Bluetooth identifier</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that inoculated people seem to emit a Bluetooth identifier that cannot be assigned to a manufacturer as usual. And that this is not always visible, possibly because the available energy of the injected chips for transmission is limited.</span></p></a>
<a id="I544" spellcheck><h2>No more trust in institutions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that they no longer trust state structures because they have experienced abuses by the executive branch, health authorities and/or state agencies. And that they therefore withdraw from the grasp of these institutions wherever possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="I545" spellcheck><h2>Population reduction: China's 2nd attempt</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that China is making yet another attempt at population reduction with its ruthless covid containment policy that cuts off its citizens from the necessities of life. And this after the 1-child policy was previously shelved in the rush for power.</span></p></a>
<a id="I546" spellcheck><h2>Increase in stillbirths after vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the number of abortions and stillbirths increased sharply with the start of the vaccination campaign. And that this correlation, in the absence of other factors, can already be taken as a strong indication of the harmful effect of vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="I547" spellcheck><h2>Many keep side effects to themselves</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that not everyone who experiences side effects, even if they persist, goes to the doctor about them, whether out of shame or lack of time. And that the official figures cannot represent the real extent.</span></p></a>
<a id="I548" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates' children are not vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that Bill Gates, contrary to his claims, has generally not had himself or his own children vaccinated, even with the regular Corona vaccines. And that this clearly shows that he is very aware of the negative effects of these injections.</span></p></a>
<a id="I549" spellcheck><h2>Severity independent of vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the severity of a covid disease is completely independent of whether someone is vaccinated or not. And that this indicates at least that the vaccination is ineffective, possibly even that other goals are being pursued with it.</span></p></a>
<a id="I550" spellcheck><h2>Statistically negative effect of vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the weak efficacy of the vaccination continues to diminish over time until it statistically slides into the negative after a few months. And that this indicates that the vaccination has a weakening effect on the immune system.</span></p></a>
<a id="I551" spellcheck><h2>Medial normalization of side effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that typical vaccination side effects such as heart attacks or psoriasis are increasingly described in the media as normal health problems. And that other causes are basically mentioned, e.g. work stress.</span></p></a>
<a id="I552" spellcheck><h2>High covid rate after vaccination/booster</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that both statistically and empirically it has long been obvious that covid illnesses have increased sharply with the start of the vaccination campaign. And that in the meantime hardly any vaccinated person has been spared from covid.</span></p></a>
<a id="I553" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine and covid damage indistinguishable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is hardly possible to distinguish between vaccination side effects and long covid sequelae due to similar symptoms. And that this is also the intention of those responsible for the continuation of their mass experiment.</span></p></a>
<a id="I554" spellcheck><h2>Much more sirens and helicopters</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that since the beginning of the vaccination campaign, they hear many more rescue helicopters and ambulance sirens than before. And that there can be no other reason for this than that people collapse and also die due to vaccination side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="I555" spellcheck><h2>Healthcare infiltrated worldwide</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that worldwide health policy and the corresponding institutions at the highest levels are infiltrated with agents of influence who follow a centrally determined agenda. And that this is the only way to explain the decisions that are made in unison.</span></p></a>
<a id="I556" spellcheck><h2>Safety should be a priority</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the safety of a medical intervention must always take precedence over its effectiveness. And that this basic medical principle is being grossly disregarded in the vaccination campaign worldwide, especially by continuing to ignore any warning signals.</span></p></a>
<a id="I557" spellcheck><h2>Re-infection after infection rare</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that anyone who has been infected with the virus naturally has a very low probability of being re-infected at a later stage. And that this probability is significantly worse in the case of artificial immunity.</span></p></a>
<a id="I558" spellcheck><h2>Many can not get infected at all</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that a large part of the population has long had cross-immunity from other respiratory infections in the past. And that these are thus neither at risk of infection nor can pass on the virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="I559" spellcheck><h2>Virus mutates only slowly</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that the virus mutates only slowly and thus its variants do not carry the risk of undermining existing natural immunity. And that natural immunity would continue to be the best strategy against the virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="I560" spellcheck><h2>Personal measures only protect against bacteria</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that even measures taken, such as wearing a mask or disinfecting hands, at best protect against bacteria, but not against viruses. And that this was part of the general knowledge of healthcare workers before the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="I561" spellcheck><h2>Black pedagogy</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that much of the communication on protective measures clearly falls into the realm of &lsquo;black pedagogy,&rsquo; especially when children are addressed in the process. And that the negative psychological consequences cannot even be estimated yet.</span></p></a>
<a id="I562" spellcheck><h2>The flu shot also has vaccination victims</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that it is an open secret that people die in nursing and old people's homes as a result of seasonal flu vaccinations, especially the seriously ill. And that in this way &lsquo;space is made&rsquo; for new residents.</span></p></a>
<a id="I563" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is a Trojan horse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccination is a Trojan horse that creates the disease it claims to protect against in the vaccinated. And that this is particularly perfidious because the symptoms and causes are indistinguishable.</span></p></a>
<a id="I564" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated much more in the hospital</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that vaccinated people worldwide have to visit hospitals much more frequently than unvaccinated people because of non-Covid indications. And that one explanation for this phenomenon is that vaccination itself is responsible for a wide range of different side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="I565" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people are victims of slow poisoning</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that people vaccinated with mRNA substances have unintentionally set processes in motion in their bodies that slowly poison them. And that due to this circumstance, symptoms of disease will appear in many only after a longer period of time.</span></p></a>
<a id="I566" spellcheck><h2>More people die from hospital germs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that compared to Covid, many millions more people worldwide die each year from hospital germs, but that little is being done about this. And that this fact clearly illustrates that the &lsquo;pandemic&rsquo; is an arbitrarily emphasized problem.</span></p></a>
<a id="I567" spellcheck><h2>More people die from environmental toxins</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, <span>that, compared to Covid, many millions more people worldwide die every year from environmental toxins, but that hardly anything is done about this.
