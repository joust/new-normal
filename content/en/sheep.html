<a id="S21" spellcheck><h2>Immunity does not last</h2>

<a id="S117" spellcheck><h2>Immune Escape</h2>

<a id="S128" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine egoism real problem</h2>

<a id="S134" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination Little Sacrifice</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that getting vaccinated is the contribution of each and every one of us to ridding the world of the pandemic. And that the minimal risk of adverse effects associated with it is, after all, a small sacrifice compared to the chance for everyone to return to normal life.</span></p></a>
<a id="S135" spellcheck><h2>Digital Vaccination Card Solution</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that because we can only defeat the pandemic if as many people as possible are vaccinated, the digital vaccination card will help us as a ticket and thus motivator to get closer to that goal as quickly as possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="S136" spellcheck><h2>Millions dead</h2>

<a id="S142" spellcheck><h2>PCR tests reliable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the PCR test procedure is proven and has a high reliability documented by many studies. And that dubious findings are usually backed by testing additional gene sections.</span></p></a>
<a id="S143" spellcheck><h2>Prevention Paradox</h2>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> <span>that the success of preventive measures makes people lose their sense of danger. Moreover, since they do little for the individual, acceptance of both the measures - and for the all-important vaccination - suffers.</span></p></a>
<a id="S144" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated will be sick</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the people who don't get vaccinated are very likely to end up with Covid, since the virus has few carriers left. And that the unvaccinated will thus be responsible for the pandemic to not end.</span></p></a>
<a id="S145" spellcheck><h2>Gurgling does little</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the assumption that you can protect yourself from contracting the virus by gargling or other home remedies would be a false one. And that such medical misinformation can be life-threatening.</span></p></a>

<a id="S150" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating means love</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that getting vaccinated is a matter of solidarity with one's fellow man after all. And that the prospect of overcoming the pandemic with joint effort should be enough to undergo this small intervention.</span></p></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the Indian variant B1.617 is causing untold suffering in the country of origin and is just spreading worldwide.

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the end everyone will have to get vaccinated so we can successfully defeat the virus. And that everyone who is re-vaccinated is a permanent threat to everyone else, which can only be countered by isolation.</span></p></a>
<a id="S155" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated make mutations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the virus can not only spread unhindered over the bodies of the unvaccinated but mutate more intensively.

<a id="S159" spellcheck><h2>Many more dead than official</h2>

<a id="S161" spellcheck><h2>Refuting Bullshit Harder</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the reasonable scientists and journalists are no match for the many, constantly new slanted claims and theories of the critics. And that refuting bullshit requires a power of ten more energy than its production.</span></p></a>
<a id="S162" spellcheck><h2>Protests increase incidence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the many people taking to the streets around the world against the Corona measures are partly to blame for our failure to overcome the pandemic. And that each new protest march without masks and distance increases the incidence again.</span></p></a>
<a id="S163" spellcheck><h2>Zoonotic diseases are on the rise</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that mankind operates thoughtless overexploitation of exotic animals, more jumps of pathogens (zoonoses) will occur in the future. And that this is simply a natural &lsquo;lesson to think about&rsquo; for us humans.</span></p></a>
<a id="S164" spellcheck><h2>Will endure vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that even if vaccination should be problematic, they think their own immune systems are strong enough to put it away. And that the advantages, such as being able to travel again, outweigh the disadvantages after all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S165" spellcheck><h2>Vaxxing for travel</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they do not want the vaccination even necessarily, but if they future otherwise not on journeys would be allowed, they this sacrifice on itself would take. After all, life is short and one should live it to the fullest.</span></p></a>
<a id="S166" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating protects the weak</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that anyone who safely refuses vaccination, even though they have a healthy and strong body, is doing so to the detriment of the weak. For even though the disease may not harm one oneself, it may harm a weaker person whom one might infect.</span></p></a>
<a id="S167" spellcheck><h2>Not yet immune</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that only after the pandemic will it be possible to live tolerably with the virus. And that until then we still have to wait until the vast majority is immune to the virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="S168" spellcheck><h2>Contact tracing solution</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that after all the best solution for a future coexistence with the virus with as little risk as possible is consistent contact tracking. And that they therefore advocate the mandatory use of appropriate apps.</span></p></a>

<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that even if the critics were right in their theories about the virus, the crisis, and the vaccination, what would be gained from that knowledge?

<a id="S171" spellcheck><h2>Virus natural</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there is enough evidence that the virus is of natural origin and came into the world through zoonosis, the jump from an animal to a human. And that claims that it might have come from a lab in Wuhan have no basis.</span></p></a>
<a id="S172" spellcheck><h2>Chinaphobia</h2>

<a id="S173" spellcheck><h2>Testing prevents outbreaks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that this helps the current testing strategy contain the virus, because infected people can be detected and isolated more quickly with all the testing.

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the many lawyers around the world who promise to help people get their rights through lawsuits in matters such as unjust measures are just making money. And that people should think twice about investing their money in such lawsuits.</span></p></a>

<a id="S177" spellcheck><h2>I just don't believe</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that these whole stories around any bad plans of dark forces are nevertheless only speculations. And that one must always ask oneself the question about the sense. Why should they do that? What would they get out of it?</span></p></a>
<a id="S178" spellcheck><h2>Explainable by profit</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that just about everything that conspiracy theorists want to explain with complicated conspiracies can also be explained simply with profit motive. Currently, for example, it is hundreds of billions in the vaccine and testing business.</span></p></a>
<a id="S179" spellcheck><h2>Ockham's razor</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the principle of Occam's razor, common in science, can also be applied to the current situation: Of several possible explanations for one and the same state of affairs, the simplest theory is preferable to all others.</span></p></a>
<a id="S180" spellcheck><h2>Close the gaps</h2>

<a id="S181" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects show effectiveness</h2>

<a id="S184" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates doesn't need money</h2>

<a id="S185" spellcheck><h2>All WHO claims</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the uniform Corona politics and -measure selection have world-wide their basis in defaults and recommendations of the World Health Organization WHO.

<a id="S192" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects easy to report</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that worldwide vaccination adverse effects have been recorded in appropriate public registries for decades.

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that anti vaxxers are egoists who rely on the willingness of the vaccinated to take a tiny risk for the greater good. And that because they refuse to vaccinate, we all have to wait longer.</span></p></a>
<a id="S194" spellcheck><h2>Politicians love power</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that overly restrictive, perverse or excessive measures that politicians enact much faster than they take them back are merely a sign of their obsession with power.</span></p></a>
<a id="S195" spellcheck><h2>Distributed among hospitals</h2>

<a id="S196" spellcheck><h2>No basic immunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there is still no basic immunity in the population against the novel virus and its many mutations. And that therefore the vaccination campaign must be carried through to the end.</span></p></a>
<a id="S197" spellcheck><h2>Everything has side effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that everything, even supposedly harmless foods and drugs, can have side effects with a certain probability. And that if you're brave enough for aspirin or chocolate, you can also get vaccinated against the virus.</span></p></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the risk of thrombosis exists in many contexts, such as flying, birth control pills, and even by the corona disease itself.

<a id="S201" spellcheck><h2>Protects against severe courses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination does not protect against contracting the virus, but it does protect against a severe course of the viral disease.

<a id="S202" spellcheck><h2>Cases only in the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that severe courses of corona occur more and more frequently only in the unvaccinated due to the progressing vaccination campaign.

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the principle of vaccination has always been to sacrifice a few to save many. And that this is also the case with the Corona vaccination, and no one claims that there are no side effects at all, but only a vanishingly small number.</span></p></a>
<a id="S209" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination makes more economic sense</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the principle of vaccination is simply the more sensible solution from the point of view of the national economy in relation to going through a disease naturally en masse. And that the aspect of sick leave should be included in decisions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S210" spellcheck><h2>Dull criticism of capitalism</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the criticism of the profits and the contractual practices of the large vaccine manufacturers is only a dull, inappropriate critique of capitalism. And that in the medical context, where life and death are at stake, different standards should be applied.</span></p></a>
<a id="S211" spellcheck><h2>mRNA technology has long been mature</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the technology mRNA vaccination is a mature solution after long years of research and only the studies could not be continued because previous corona virus pandemics like SARS have ended on their own.</span></p></a>
<a id="S212" spellcheck><h2>Locking out non-vaccinated people to protect them</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the regulations introduced in many countries to exclude non-vaccinated people from social life, cultural events and shops also serve their own protection. And that they can regain access at any time through vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S213" spellcheck><h2>No right to infect others</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people do not have to vaccinate themselves, but that by not vaccinating they practically take over the right to infect others. And that they do not have this right and therefore the state must ensure the physical integrity of others through its measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S214" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are trained</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the dissenters to Corona typically do not have the necessary medical training to be able to assess the correctness of the Corona measures supported by the vast majority of doctors. And that they should therefore be cautious about their views.</span></p></a>
<a id="S215" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are experienced</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the dissenters to Corona typically do not have the requisite experience as medical practitioners to be able to assess the correctness of the Corona measures carried out by the vast majority of doctors. And that they should therefore be cautious with their assessments.</span></p></a>
<a id="S216" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are mild</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although there is a lot of talk about side effects of vaccination, these are usually mild side effects such as brief pain in the arm or headaches. And that these effects can also be observed with other vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S217" spellcheck><h2>Safety standards complied with</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that while the vaccines were developed in an accelerated process to get results faster, all safety standards were met in the process. And that one can therefore have confidence in them.</span></p></a>
<a id="S218" spellcheck><h2>Sufficiently less contagious</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that re-vaccinated people therefore no longer need to be tested, that they are sufficiently less infectious compared to non-vaccinated people. And that about the renunciation of testing yes must also give an incentive to vaccinate.</span></p></a>
<a id="S219" spellcheck><h2>What pressure?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the alleged social pressure to vaccinate is in fact no pressure, but merely a sensible policy in the sense of epidemiology. And that whoever refuses this cannot speak of repression.</span></p></a>
<a id="S220" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinations greatest achievement</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is common knowledge that vaccinations are one of the greatest medical achievements in human history. And that it is incomprehensible that so many people have turned away from this concept.</span></p></a>
<a id="S221" spellcheck><h2>No right to eat in a restaurant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the restrictions on non-vaccinated people are merely political measures to contain a pandemic. And that you cannot invoke your fundamental rights when you are excluded from restaurants and shops.</span></p></a>
<a id="S222" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to contribute</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that most non-vaccinated stay cold, they do not want to contribute to a finally back to normal life for all. And that this is a sign of how stupid and uneducated our society has become!</span></p></a>
<a id="S223" spellcheck><h2>Fear of control = more control</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the fear of state control in the Corona context ultimately creates the precondition for the need for more state control. And that this vicious circle can only be broken by obedience.</span></p></a>
<a id="S224" spellcheck><h2>Seeing DNA change as an opportunity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>...that if you think an mRNA vaccine will change your DNA, think of it as an opportunity...</span></p></a>
<a id="S225" spellcheck><h2>100% vaccination rate = 100% vaccinated sick people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the reference to vaccinated people who are also infected with the virus and treated in hospital makes little sense if large parts of the population are already vaccinated. And that with a 100% vaccination rate, all sick people are vaccinated.</span></p></a>
<a id="S226" spellcheck><h2>Be calm, it'll soon be over</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the pandemic will be over at some point and that we should just be more relaxed until then. And that with the great goal of ending the pandemic in mind, the measures can be endured in a much more relaxed manner.</span></p></a>
<a id="S227" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines no long-term effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the current Corona vaccines cannot have any negative long-term effects, if only because their principle of operation renders them ineffective in a short time. And that concerns in this regard are unfounded.</span></p></a>
<a id="S228" spellcheck><h2>Pharma companies communicates poorly</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that, pharma industry is already doing some &lsquo;crooked&rsquo; things and communicating poorly and that is reason for denial. But that this denial is inappropriate in this case and keeps us all stuck in the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S229" spellcheck><h2>We only have to vaccinate everyone</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if everyone had been vaccinated, there would be far fewer infections and the health system would be far from overburdened. And that with a maximum vaccination rate we would have overcome the pandemic long ago.</span></p></a>
<a id="S230" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated are threat</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people are a threat to society within a pandemic, as their refusal to do so makes it impossible to overcome the crisis together. And that society therefore has a right to defend itself against them, just as it must defend itself against terrorism.</span></p></a>
<a id="S231" spellcheck><h2>Not a doctor / scientist</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that to Corona dissenters are just not doctors or scientists and therefore can not overlook the complex situation. And that more trust in the knowledge and experience of the experts would be more than appropriate.</span></p></a>
<a id="S232" spellcheck><h2>Don't know any</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they do not have any serious side effects in their family and circle of acquaintances and that the problem can therefore not be so relevant. And that at the same time, in any case, but they know many Corona victims.</span></p></a>
<a id="S233" spellcheck><h2>Do not allow the state to be blackmailed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the state must not allow itself to be blackmailed by the dissenters to Corona and their demonstrations and other protest actions. And that the state in the pandemic has above all to ensure the enforcement of the interests of the majority.</span></p></a>
<a id="S234" spellcheck><h2>Exclusion is important</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the exclusion of non-vaccinated people from social life has an important educational function. And that in this way they can be made aware that they themselves are contributing to an unnecessary prolongation of the exceptional situation and should do something about it through their vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S235" spellcheck><h2>Side effects / vaccination deaths coincidence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many people die every day and that this fact alone results in a probability of dying after a vaccination. And that we observe as supposed side effects and vaccination deaths in connection with the high number of vaccinations mainly this effect.</span></p></a>
<a id="S236" spellcheck><h2>Relaxations only with a high vaccination rate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the call for relaxations must not be followed, since a high vaccination rate is a prerequisite for the withdrawal of measures. And that this connection is clearly proven by field studies in other countries.</span></p></a>
<a id="S237" spellcheck><h2>Just personal anecdotes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that when people report side effects in themselves or in their environment, these are only personal anecdotes that cannot be generalized. And that these have no statistical relevance.</span></p></a>
<a id="S238" spellcheck><h2>Nothing happens with billions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if you include the side effect reports, after all, practically nothing has happened with billions of vaccinations. And that the advantages of the globally successful vaccination campaign clearly outweigh the disadvantages such as the side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S239" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people get sick worse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people have been shown to contract corona fastest and worst, and are more likely to end up in intensive care. And that they are thus more likely to become a burden on the healthcare system and thus on their fellow human beings.</span></p></a>
<a id="S240" spellcheck><h2>Delegitimization of the state by critics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the state must resist all attempts to be delegitimized by Corona critics. And that this danger exists especially when the executive fails to act decisively when laws and regulations are violated.</span></p></a>
<a id="S241" spellcheck><h2>Not spreading nonsense is not one-sided</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that media that refrain from spreading unsubstantiated information or even total nonsense do not automatically report in a one-sided manner. And that they are bound by certain quality standards that don't apply to sources like Telegram.</span></p></a>
<a id="S242" spellcheck><h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the Dunning-Kruger effect is at work in many too Corona dissenters, i.e. they are incompetent people who overestimate their own knowledge and ability. And that this is based on the inability to judge themselves objectively by means of metacognition.</span></p></a>
<a id="S243" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy places</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the fact that non-vaccinated people fall ill more often and more severely during the pandemic has the effect of an increasing the number of hospital beds occupied by them. And that these beds are no longer available for other patients.</span></p></a>
<a id="S244" spellcheck><h2>State of the art</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the image presented to the public on the crisis and its background is created by recourse to experts and represents the state of science. And that alternative views are mostly unscientific or scientific sideshows.</span></p></a>
<a id="S245" spellcheck><h2>You do not have the absolute truth</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many dissenters to Corona often appear so self-confident and convinced, as if they had the absolute truth. And that one could not take them seriously already because of this missing self-reflection and -criticism.</span></p></a>
<a id="S246" spellcheck><h2>Self-proclaimed critics/journalists</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many pretentious and incompetent people pose as critics and journalists in the Corona context without having the necessary skills. And that these are rightly written down or ignored by the major media.</span></p></a>
<a id="S247" spellcheck><h2>State cares, makes vaccinations free</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the state cares about its citizens in the pandemic by providing vaccinations free of charge to all. And that it is ungrateful and selfish to refuse this offer for the benefit of all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S248" spellcheck><h2>Defiance phase like with children</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the negative attitude of vaccination opponents often reminds without any evidence strongly of the defiant phase known from childhood, which one should actually have overcome in adulthood.</span></p></a>
<a id="S249" spellcheck><h2>Do not reward the unsolid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that, unsound behaviour must not be further rewarded, otherwise the pillars of our society are in danger.</span></p></a>
<a id="S250" spellcheck><h2>Higher contributions for vaccination refusers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination refusers are irresponsible with their bodies, comparable to couch potatoes or bungee jumpers. And that they are a burden on the solidarity community and should therefore be charged higher contributions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S251" spellcheck><h2>The government would never do that</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they cannot imagine their own government being ruthless enough for such a far-reaching deception of its own people. And that the critics' assumptions in this direction are unrealistically far-reaching.</span></p></a>
<a id="S252" spellcheck><h2>WITH but not ON: double standards</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that just as one can argue that many died not ON but WITH the virus, one can argue analogously that many died not ON but WITH the vaccination. And that whoever doesn't want to see that, has double standards.</span></p></a>
<a id="S253" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people are largely responsible for the continuation of the pandemic, as they fall ill more frequently and more severely and thus place excessive demands on medical care structures. And that it is therefore only fair to exclude them from social life through selected measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S254" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs because not 100% protection</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination breakthroughs can be explained, because the vaccination does not protect 100%. And that even insbeonsdere pre-existing conditions and other factors can reduce their effectiveness.</span></p></a>
<a id="S255" spellcheck><h2>Only non-vaccinated people in intensive care units</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that, according to official data from hospitals, almost only non-vaccinated people are treated in intensive care units. And that this information is nevertheless a clear indication that the pandemic goes on and on, mainly due to vaccination refusers.</span></p></a>
<a id="S256" spellcheck><h2>The only thing missing is the next booster</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the reason for the increase in covid cases even among vaccinated people is that their vaccination was already too far back to be sufficiently effective. And that therefore they have only lacked the booster to continue to escape the disease.</span></p></a>
<a id="S257" spellcheck><h2>Zoo animals also already vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the meantime even zoo animals have been vaccinated against Corona. And that as a critic one does not want to be inferior to them after all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S258" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems only imagined</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many people, often due to misinformation on the net, misinterpret signals of their own body and imagine, for example, to have heart problems or the like after vaccination. And that you can also put people unnecessarily in fear of a harmless and safe intervention.</span></p></a>
<a id="S259" spellcheck><h2>In the past also &lsquo;suddenly and unexpectedly&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that also in former times people died suddenly and unexpectedly and now one only blames the vaccination for it, because it just fits to the own point of view.</span></p></a>
<a id="S260" spellcheck><h2>Critics just look for matching papers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the Corona-critics are just looking for the appropriate scientific papers for their views on the net, without knowing the scientifically correct procedure, let alone being able to read the papers properly.</span></p></a>
<a id="S261" spellcheck><h2>Own freedom stops with the others</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the deliberately unvaccinated are a health hazard to everyone else around them. And that in their insistence on their freedoms they overlook the fact that these freedoms end where the rights of others begin.</span></p></a>
<a id="S262" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated courage fills hospitals</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that before vaccination, many people refrained from hospital visits for fear of infection. And that now, with renewed courage, hospitals are filling up with many non-Corona cases.</span></p></a>
<a id="S263" spellcheck><h2>All side effects also with Covid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that all the potentially feared side effects of vaccination, including thrombosis, myocarditis, etc., are much more common with Covid infection and have a much more difficult course. And that therefore everything that is scary about vaccination should be much more scary about covid infection.</span></p></a>
<a id="S264" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated are still not dead</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the thesis that vaccinated people will die in a few months turns out to be misinformation, because we vaccinated people are still not dead. And that something must have gone wrong with this prognosis.</span></p></a>
<a id="S265" spellcheck><h2>Functioning society only with commitment</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that you can't have everything without giving something in return. And that in a functioning society egoism has no place and that egoists must also feel this.</span></p></a>
<a id="S266" spellcheck><h2>Triage for non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they advocate triage for non-vaccinated people, because those who don't get vaccinated now act at their own risk and shouldn't take away anyone else's ICU space.</span></p></a>
<a id="S267" spellcheck><h2>Egoism accusation freedom of speech</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the accusation of egoism against the deliberately non-vaccinated also falls under the freedom of opinion which they so vehemently propagate. And that their indignation about it therefore amounts to a double standard.</span></p></a>
<a id="S268" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people the test does not help</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if a non-vaccinated person tests negative before going to a restaurant or theater, that doesn't protect him from catching the virus from a vaccinated person there. And the latter then possibly blocking the intensive care bed a few days later, which an accident victim urgently needs.</span></p></a>
<a id="S269" spellcheck><h2>Socialist compulsory vaccination has worked well</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that compulsory vaccination could be a possible, restrictive way to overcome the pandemic if all other incentives for voluntary vaccination fail. And that good experience has already been made with this in former socialist countries.</span></p></a>
<a id="S270" spellcheck><h2>Who harms the majority =&gt; consequences</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that whoever makes a decision as an adult that potentially harms the majority society must also bear the consequences of that decision. And that we can no longer afford to be considerate of the inconsiderate and selfish if we want to defeat the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S271" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination myths are a problem for everyone</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the many myths and conspiracy narratives circulating on the net are preventing many people from doing their part to overcome the pandemic. And that it must therefore be seen as a problem for all of us to combat.</span></p></a>
<a id="S272" spellcheck><h2>If smallpox still had</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that all the misinformation on the Internet is preventing us from defeating the virus. And that, fortunately, the Internet has not been around that long, otherwise mankind would probably never have succeeded in eradicating polio and smallpox.</span></p></a>
<a id="S273" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are immune reaction</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the s are not from the vaccination, but from the immune response it triggers. And that the same immune reaction would have occurred in the case of an infection.</span></p></a>
<a id="S274" spellcheck><h2>Common good trumps self-determination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there are situations in which the common good outweighs self-determination and individual freedoms. And that the current pandemic and global vaccination campaign to overcome it is just such a case.</span></p></a>
<a id="S275" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous horse dewormer</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the ivermectin advertised by vaccination opponents is an unproven and therefore dangerous drug from veterinary medicine used to deworm horses. And that one should urgently refrain from treating with it.</span></p></a>
<a id="S276" spellcheck><h2>Compensation fund for vaccination damage</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that for the rare vaccination damages, which are and have been caused by mass vaccinations, appropriate compensation funds have long been established. And that there is therefore no insurance problem.</span></p></a>
<a id="S277" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs in patients with severe pre-conditions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the protection provided by vaccination is very high, but that serious illnesses can still occur if patients have risk factors such as previous illnesses, obesity or a weak or suppressed immune system. And that vaccination cannot perform miracles.</span></p></a>
<a id="S278" spellcheck><h2>Long experience with vaccinations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that mankind has hundreds of years of experience and success with the principle of vaccination behind it. And that we are benefiting from this experience in dealing with the current pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S279" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccination is known and safe</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that mRNA vaccines have been researched for many decades and therefore s and problems are well known. And that they can therefore be considered safe.</span></p></a>
<a id="S280" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people are pandemic drivers</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the remaining non-vaccinated pose a risk of infection to everyone else due to their higher susceptibility to the virus. And that they must therefore be kept away from the public as further drivers of the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S281" spellcheck><h2>Intensive care beds also need staff</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the reference to free intensive care beds does not allow any statement about the real capacities, since personnel is always required to operate them. And that it is therefore not meaningful to consider the number of beds alone.</span></p></a>
<a id="S282" spellcheck><h2>Balancing of civil rights</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who insist on their fundamental rights in times of pandemic overlook the right to health of their fellow human beings. And that this right weighs just as much as the rights they demand, and that politicians must therefore weigh them up.</span></p></a>
<a id="S283" spellcheck><h2>Powerlessness against non-vaccinated people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the non-vaccinated are imprisoning the rest of society by their refusal and therefore you are angry and feel powerless.</span></p></a>
<a id="S284" spellcheck><h2>Late effects not to be expected</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that long experience with vaccinations show that the feared s that only appear a long time after vaccination are not to be expected. And that vaccinations usually unfold their effect within a manageable period of time.</span></p></a>
<a id="S285" spellcheck><h2>My vaccination prevented worse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they have had Covid after the vaccination, but that it would have been much worse if they had not been vaccinated. And that they are glad to have been vaccinated.</span></p></a>
<a id="S286" spellcheck><h2>Asymptomatic transmission also with herpes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the effect of assymptomatic transmission is not at all absurd, but also occurs in other diseases such as herpes.</span></p></a>
<a id="S287" spellcheck><h2>Individual responsibility</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one feels a personal responsibility for immunocompromised or -suppressed colleagues and relatives in one's own environment and therefore adheres to the prescribed measures and not because of one's own risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="S288" spellcheck><h2>False adverse event reports</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination opponents flood the reporting system for adverse events with false reports, just as they have been shown to influence media surveys. And that therefore no conclusions can be drawn from the high reporting figures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S289" spellcheck><h2>Denmark's about-face?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>what about Denmark's about-face after their Freedom Day? And that it's probably not as easy to return to normality as the critics would like.</span></p></a>
<a id="S290" spellcheck><h2>How to drive drunk</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that refusal to vaccinate without good reason is equivalent to driving drunk, because you also endanger not only themselves but also others. Indeed, sober people also build accidents, but here the probability is lower.</span></p></a>
<a id="S291" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs only in risk groups</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination breakthroughs are not a general phenomenon but occur mainly in risk groups with pre-existing conditions. And that this effect is also understandable, because here the vaccination can do less than in healthy people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S292" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people take society hostage</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that by insisting on their freedom and self-determination over their bodies, the non-vaccinated are practically taking the sensible rest of society hostage. For through their attitude a return to normality is not possible.</span></p></a>
<a id="S293" spellcheck><h2>No treatment for non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people, as they deliberately take the greater risk of falling ill and possibly burdening the health system in the process, would have to forego treatment or cope with being the very last to be treated in an overload situation.</span></p></a>
<a id="S294" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy beds</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people occupy hospital beds unnecessarily and thus use up the reserves early. And that, as a result, the responsible, vaccinated rest of the population has to endure the corresponding measures that would not otherwise have been necessary.</span></p></a>
<a id="S295" spellcheck><h2>Financial participation of non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is time to think about financial participation in medical costs for non-vaccinated people. And that otherwise at the expense of the whole society people are treated who consciously renounce a risk minimization.</span></p></a>
<a id="S296" spellcheck><h2>Lax controls irresponsible</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the catering and club sector, compliance with the rules is often not properly controlled and that this can lead to outbreaks again and again. And that therefore more control of the controllers with sensitive penalties must take place.</span></p></a>
<a id="S297" spellcheck><h2>Side effects rate normal</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if you put the s of the Corona vaccine in relation to the quantities vaccinated - billions of people - their proportion is vanishingly small. And that the risks are comparable to those of classical vaccines.</span></p></a>
<a id="S298" spellcheck><h2>Compensation solution is long since in place</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that, as with all other recommended vaccines, there is already a state compensation scheme in place. And that one is therefore already covered against the risk of becoming a victim of the very rare s.</span></p></a>
<a id="S299" spellcheck><h2>Liability exemption makes vaccination possible</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that exempting vaccine manufacturers from liability is what makes the successful fight against pandemics possible in the first place. And that if politicians had insisted on manufacturer liability for damages, we would not have vaccines at all now.</span></p></a>
<a id="S300" spellcheck><h2>Virus contact inevitable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the next three years it's very likely that everyone will come into contact with the virus. And that you will then either be dead or recovered, with the vaccination rather the latter.</span></p></a>
<a id="S301" spellcheck><h2>Duties convince the unwilling</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that other areas of life with corresponding risks show that you can only convince the unwilling with obligations. And that good examples of this are the seat belt and helmet obligations in road traffic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S302" spellcheck><h2>Spain and Portugal successful</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the numbers are lower or falling in countries like Spain and Portugal with high vaccination rates. And that their vaccination programmes have successfully contained the pandemic and should therefore be used as a model for other countries.</span></p></a>
<a id="S303" spellcheck><h2>Test exemption required as motivation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the test exemption for vaccinated people is not completely conclusive, as they can still be infectious. But that this is a matter of consideration, since this exemption is absolutely necessary as a motivation and incentive for vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S304" spellcheck><h2>Side effects rarer than lightning strike</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the risk of fatal side effects from vaccination is less than being struck by lightning. And that fears of these are irrational and do not do justice to the real probabilities.</span></p></a>
<a id="S305" spellcheck><h2>After a few days through the body</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the active substances of the vaccination are already out of the body a few days after the injection. And that they do not act further than 10cm away from the injection site in the body.</span></p></a>
<a id="S306" spellcheck><h2>Cannot penetrate cell nucleus</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the administered genetic information in the mRNA or vector vaccines does not penetrate into cell nuclei. And that therefore there is also no possibility that one's own genetic information could be changed by the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S307" spellcheck><h2>Adverse event reports can be duplicates</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the portals for recording adverse events are automated and that there is no verification of the reports. And that the data there is not reliable, because everyone can report something there as often as they want.</span></p></a>
<a id="S308" spellcheck><h2>So far only lucky with mutations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that we as humanity have so far only been lucky during the pandemic that no really dangerous mutations have arisen. And things can get much worse if the virus becomes significantly more deadly or significantly more contagious than before.</span></p></a>
<a id="S309" spellcheck><h2>Covid deaths not registered</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there are many covid victims who died in private, who were not hospitalized and for whom no tests were performed. And that this dark figure strongly distorts the statistics into the positive.</span></p></a>
<a id="S310" spellcheck><h2>Omicron variant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the mutation B.1.1.529 or Omikron combines the dangerousness of several other mutations. And that the danger of this variant for the public health system comes in particular from its high infection rate.</span></p></a>
<a id="S311" spellcheck><h2>Politics has failed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that we would have overcome the pandemic in our own country long ago if politics had not failed. And that this failure is primarily due to a lack of laws and regulations, or laws and regulations that are too lax, and insufficient state intervention against critics and objectors.</span></p></a>
<a id="S312" spellcheck><h2>Refused tests on Covid deaths</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that families of the deceased often enforce that no test be done or that Covid not be on the cause of death on the death certificate to save themselves the hassle and restrictions of a Covid burial. And that this distorts the statistics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S313" spellcheck><h2>Covid victim despite negative test</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that patients who test negative again weeks after contracting the disease can still die from the damage it caused. And that it therefore makes sense to always assume Covid as the cause of death if there was a positive test within a certain period of time before death.</span></p></a>
<a id="S314" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination boosts male fertility</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the Covid vaccination improves the sperm quality of the male. And that it has no negative but even a positive effect on male fertility.</span></p></a>
<a id="S315" spellcheck><h2>Corona infection worsens fertility</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a passed infection with the coronavirus can harm the sexual health of the man. And that this is another reason why vaccination is a sensible protective measure.</span></p></a>
<a id="S316" spellcheck><h2>Statistics of one</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that people usually base their assessment of risks on their own experience. And that one's own not getting sick or the lack of victims in one's own environment can give one a false sense of security.</span></p></a>
<a id="S317" spellcheck><h2>Telegram Fates Are Fake</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the many fates of side effect victims communicated via alternative media channels like Telegram are typically fake. And that it is better to rely on official, verified sources to assess the real situation.</span></p></a>
<a id="S318" spellcheck><h2>Current excess mortality is &lsquo;post-harvest&rsquo;</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the significant excess mortality observed in many cases since the start of the vaccination campaigns has nothing to do with vaccination, but that the victims are rather the natural &lsquo;after-harvest&rsquo; of the closed period created by the previous lockdowns.</span></p></a>
<a id="S319" spellcheck><h2>No correlation for side effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the causal relationship to vaccination cannot be established for most side effects. And that the occurrence of diseases and also deaths in a temporal context due to the immense number of vaccinations can also be explained by statistical coincidence.</span></p></a>
<a id="S320" spellcheck><h2>Young people not invulnerable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that currently many young people believe themselves invulnerable to the virus and therefore even provoke the infection. And that this is a fallacy that many will pay for with their health or even their lives.</span></p></a>
<a id="S321" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people are a risk for all</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that non-vaccinated people play with the risk of all, because even a negative test does not protect them from catching the virus. And that they might then block an intensive care bed that an accident victim urgently needs.</span></p></a>
<a id="S322" spellcheck><h2>Basic trust in processes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is paradoxical that people in crisis abandon their trust in some tried and tested mechanisms, but cling to them in other areas. And that the lack of common ground makes them difficult if not impossible to reach.</span></p></a>
<a id="S323" spellcheck><h2>The world is as it seems</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is safe to assume that the world out there is as it appears and conspiracies are much more difficult than many think. After all, different interests are hard to reconcile and collusion hard to keep secret.</span></p></a>
<a id="S324" spellcheck><h2>Expertise has its meaning</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that not everyone can be knowledgeable in all areas and that it therefore makes sense in the rules to rely on experts instead of overestimating oneself. And that this division of tasks is what makes our complex world controllable in the first place.</span></p></a>
<a id="S325" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous to the state</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a considerable part of the critics of the Corona policy no longer believe in the political structures and mechanisms of democracy and act openly hostile to the state. And that therefore the state and protection of the bourgeois majority must act even more rigorously against these people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S326" spellcheck><h2>Aspiration not necessary</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that aspiration prior to injection of the vaccines is not necessary according to official recommendations because the blood vessels at the body sites recommended for injection and within reach of the needle are too small for accidental intravascular administration. And that there are no reports of injury to patients due to failure to aspirate.</span></p></a>
<a id="S327" spellcheck><h2>Pandemics are not a novelty</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there have always been pandemics in the history of mankind, e.g. the Spanish flu, so why not in our time as well? Currently, the probability of a pandemic is possibly even higher, since we as humanity are becoming more and more and this is so unsustainable when it comes to the symbiosis with and the preservation of our environment.</span></p></a>
<a id="S328" spellcheck><h2>Recurring vaccinations have been around for long</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the devaluation of the Corona Booster vaccinations as a vaccination subscription or trap falsely suggests that they contain a novel element, when there have long been vaccinations that are regularly administered to be effective, such as the flu or tick vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S329" spellcheck><h2>Of course the pandemic is exploited</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the crisis situation that the pandemic represents worldwide is of course being exploited by many interest groups. But that this does not necessarily mean that they have also brought about the crisis in the form of an unrealistic, comprehensive conspiracy in order to achieve their goals.</span></p></a>
<a id="S330" spellcheck><h2>Moral obligation to vaccinate</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the current crisis, which we can only overcome with joint efforts and joint sacrifices, one can at least speak of a moral duty to vaccinate. And that whoever opposes this must at least expect to be confronted with this moral violation by his fellow human beings.</span></p></a>
<a id="S331" spellcheck><h2>Darwin Award for non-vaccinated people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the sarcastic negative award for people who harm or kill themselves through their own fault and show a special degree of stupidity should also be given to the group of non-vaccinated people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S332" spellcheck><h2>Omicron not a wave but a wall</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that with the new variant Omikron, due to its high infection rate, one must no longer speak of just an epidemic wave but of a wall. And that this expected excess of infected people, even with less severe diseases, has the potential to overburden the health system.</span></p></a>
<a id="S333" spellcheck><h2>Politics again and again the same mistakes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a nationwide lockdown is not always appropriate, and that tough regional restrictions can sometimes be sufficient. But where there is lockdown on it, there must also be lockdown in it, because we really have had enough half-heartedness in politics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S334" spellcheck><h2>Kennedy was always a nutcase</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that Robert F. Kennedy, one of the central figures for the dissenters, has been an irrational anti-vaxxer and self-proclaimed child protector since before the crisis. And that there is therefore no reason to trust him on any issues now.</span></p></a>
<a id="S335" spellcheck><h2>Athletes also collapsed earlier</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that athletes have always been at risk due to the heavy physical strain. And that without reliable comparative figures from the past, it is not possible to assess the many collapses.</span></p></a>
<a id="S336" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims only suspected cases</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that all cases reported in the adverse events databases are only suspected cases. And since it can hardly be established with certainty that there is a causal connection to vaccination, these figures do not allow any statements to be made about the proportion of vaccine injuries.</span></p></a>
<a id="S337" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine doses ordered for the third world</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the many vaccines pre-ordered en masse by the EU and other major nations are likely to be made available to poorer countries in the future. And that no alleged plans for a longer duration of the pandemic can be derived from these orders.</span></p></a>
<a id="S338" spellcheck><h2>Clearly a mass psychosis</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the opposition and the arguments of the Corona critics can meanwhile be seen as a mass psychosis, since delusions of totalitarian world domination and vaccination conspiracies prevail here. And that this psychosis is still fueled by many beneficiaries.</span></p></a>
<a id="S339" spellcheck><h2>Now everything's a vaccine side effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the critics of the vaccination now seem to interpret every health change in their environment as a vaccination side effect. And in doing so, they ignore the fact that there are coincidences and also that people age and in the course of this also decline in health.</span></p></a>
<a id="S340" spellcheck><h2>Compulsory vaccination helps save face</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many critics of vaccination now have no way of backing away from their position and saving face. And that a vaccination obligation helps exactly these people to get out of the blockade attitude by the state default.</span></p></a>
<a id="S341" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine remains in your arm</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the vaccine cannot be responsible for the many alleged side effects, since it remains in the arm of the vaccinated person. And that the few cases are more likely to be a coincidence than real side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S342" spellcheck><h2>Refreshers useful until the end of the pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that every individual can contribute to a quick end of the pandemic by following the official recommendations for booster vaccinations. And that, since the effect is limited, these boosters are logically useful until the end of the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S343" spellcheck><h2>Relatively few vaccination breakthroughs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the critics' highlighting of vaccine breakthroughs only serves to call into question the effectiveness of vaccination. And that in reality very few suffer such a breakthrough in relation to the total number of vaccinated people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S344" spellcheck><h2>Rapid approval to contain the pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the much-criticised fast-track procedure for testing and approving vaccines was necessary precisely because a global pandemic had to be contained. And that only this speed saved the world from a much worse course of the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="S345" spellcheck><h2>Omicron could end pandemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the now prevailing omicron variant with its much milder course could mean an end to the pandemic, as it resembles influenza in its dangerousness. And that now possibly the policy could be directed towards an acceptance of the risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="S346" spellcheck><h2>Anti-Vaxers in the 19th century</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the refusal to vaccinate already existed with smallpox vaccination in 19th century Europe. And that then as now, people were led astray by irrational fears and unscientific claims.</span></p></a>
<a id="S347" spellcheck><h2>Infection is dirty immunization</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that contracting the virus directly without prior vaccination protection is a kind of risky, dirty immunization. And that while you can do it, vaccination is a much safer and cleaner way to immunize yourself.</span></p></a>
<a id="S348" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination signals acceptance of the measures</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the fact that the vast majority of people worldwide are choosing to be vaccinated is a clear signal of approval of government protective measures and regulations. And that the critics only mobilize a tiny part of the population.</span></p></a>
<a id="S349" spellcheck><h2>No real discrimination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the discrimination by social exclusion claimed by the vaccination critics is in fact not discrimination at all, since the vaccination status is not an unchangeable characteristic like homosexuality and skin color.</span></p></a>
<a id="S350" spellcheck><h2>I trust the science</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the vast majority of scientists share a uniform view of the danger of corona and the benefits of vaccinations. And that they, as representatives of science, are trusted more than the isolated critics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S351" spellcheck><h2>Corona shrinks the Penis</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one of the possible long-term consequences of a corona infection for men is the shortening of their penis. And that this risk has to be reason enough to protect oneself by vaccination!</span></p></a>
<a id="S352" spellcheck><h2>Side effects often nocebo effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many vaccination side effects such as headaches are actually results of the nocebo effect, i.e. the cause is not the vaccination but the negative expectations of the vaccinated person. And that therefore in the end the widespread fear stories are themselves responsible for the side effects!</span></p></a>
<a id="S353" spellcheck><h2>Heart muscle inflammation also infection</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that myocarditis can also be caused by infection with Covid. And that attribution of such a diagnosis as a vaccination side effect</span></p></a>
<a id="S354" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects at-risk patients</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the collective vaccination of the population makes sense, because in this way risk patients are protected who, for example, cannot vaccinate themselves. And that this small act of mutual consideration is not too much to ask.</span></p></a>
<a id="S355" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination strengthens the immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination is currently the best way to prepare one's own immune system for pathogens and thus to strengthen it. And that trying to strengthen one's immune system by going through an illness, on the other hand, is a strategy that makes little sense.</span></p></a>
<a id="S356" spellcheck><h2>Diseases weaken the immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that diseases, especially covid, weaken the immune system, contrary to popular belief. And that these should therefore be avoided, for example by getting vaccinated against them.</span></p></a>
<a id="S357" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is mandatory in health care</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that compulsory vaccination is being introduced worldwide for employees who work in the healthcare sector, and quite rightly so. And that they are wrong to complain about it, because it is a very clear protective measure out of responsibility for the patients.</span></p></a>
<a id="S358" spellcheck><h2>Just a little prick!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination is just a little prick that you don't have to be afraid of. And that the remaining unvaccinated would only have to overcome their needle phobia to get us all out of this mess.</span></p></a>
<a id="S359" spellcheck><h2>PIMS risk for children high</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that especially for children after corona disease, the risk of developing MIS/PIMS is very high. And that therefore</p></a>
<a id="S360" spellcheck><h2>There are so beautiful masks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there are now so many beautiful designs and colors for medical masks, just as there were at the beginning of the fabric masks. And that their own safety must be so at least no longer an aesthetic problem.</span></p></a>
<a id="S361" spellcheck><h2>Already used to masks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that masks have been used for many years and they feel comfortable with them. And that they will therefore probably continue to use this protection after the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S362" spellcheck><h2>No lipstick needed because of masks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they like the masks, because you have to invest less effort in makeup and lipstick and can generally hide yourself and your flaws behind it. And that the masks like everything also have a good side.</span></p></a>
<a id="S363" spellcheck><h2>Booster is valid indefinitely</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that despite the technical certificate validity of 12 months, the booster vaccination is valid indefinitely. And that you should not be confused by whispers about a lifetime vaccination subscription.</span></p></a>
<a id="S364" spellcheck><h2>Normal signs of aging</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that physical problems, which many people consider to be side effects of vaccination, are in fact normal symptoms of aging. And that this circumstance massively distorts the statistical side effect data.</span></p></a>
<a id="S365" spellcheck><h2>For research Corona was good</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the pandemic has decisively advanced new technologies for disease treatment such as mRNA vaccines. And that we will benefit from them for many other diseases in the future.</span></p></a>
<a id="S366" spellcheck><h2>More cancer is pandemic consequence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the increasing number of cancer victims is a consequence of the pandemic, as fewer people go for early cancer detection, surgery and treatment are postponed in hospitals, and follow-up care also suffers. And that this has nothing to do with vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S367" spellcheck><h2>Risks higher for the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the risks in terms of disease and disease progression are demonstrably higher for the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated. And that it is therefore irrational to refuse vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S368" spellcheck><h2>Silent Triage</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although direct triage due to Covid does not play a role in hospitals, silent triage for other diseases such as cancer has long been taking place due to the pandemic. And that the pandemic must also be urgently overcome for this reason.</span></p></a>
<a id="S369" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination refusal often childhood trauma</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the rejection of vaccination by many people is not rationally justified but can be traced back to childhood traumas. And that global health security cannot be made dependent on such individual characteristics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S370" spellcheck><h2>Omicron mainly affects unvaccinated people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the omicron variant, although more contagious and less dangerous, mainly affects the unvaccinated. And that these are therefore responsible for the fact that we must continue to protect our health care through measures of all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S371" spellcheck><h2>Not to be taken seriously because of other areas</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one cannot take oneself or critics' voices on Corona seriously, as they are already off the mark in other areas, e.g. climate change or gender issues.</span></p></a>
<a id="S372" spellcheck><h2>Do not be of the same opinion as...</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that you can't have the same opinion as person XY on a question, because you don't want to have anything in common with this person. And that this is a logically understandable reason.</span></p></a>
<a id="S373" spellcheck><h2>You know the truth, but experts don't?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>whether you as a layman really think you know the truth better than the majority of experts worldwide? And that this is quite presumptuous and more humility would be appropriate here.</span></p></a>
<a id="S374" spellcheck><h2>Will get vaccinated against everything</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that for them the Corona vaccination was a natural decision, since they basically use all possibilities to vaccinate themselves against diseases as a precaution. And that everyone can use this.</span></p></a>
<a id="S375" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects children from MIS/PIMS</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that vaccination protects children not only from severe corona courses, but also from the covid after-effect of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. And that this is characterized by inflammation in organs such as the skin, heart, gastrointestinal tract, mucous membranes, lungs, liver and kidneys.</p></a>
<a id="S376" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of violence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that aggressive mask refusers and vaccination opponents pose a daily risk to all those who must sacrifice themselves against the pandemic and enforce the Corona rules. And that thousands of injuries and deaths worldwide show who the real aggressor is.</span></p></a>
<a id="S377" spellcheck><h2>Canadian truckers danger for all</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the large trucker protest in Canada represents only a small minority in relation to the total population. And that the country must not allow itself to be blackmailed by this minority in its delivery and supply structures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S378" spellcheck><h2>Novavax is the alternative</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who refuse the vaccination because of the novel mRNA technology now have an alternative classical vaccine in Novavax. And that there is no longer any reason to refuse vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S379" spellcheck><h2>State capitulates to those willing to be vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if those willing to vaccinate manage to escape the appeals and restrictions, the state has given up in the fight against the pandemic. And that if rules are hardly controlled or revoked by courts, this will pay off in the end.</span></p></a>
<a id="S380" spellcheck><h2>More and more vaccination opponents decide to</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that more and more opponents of vaccination are now deciding in favor of vaccination for a variety of reasons. And that one should take an example from them and provide oneself with effective protection.</span></p></a>
<a id="S381" spellcheck><h2>First crisis experience for many</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that for many, the pandemic is the first time they have experienced a crisis in society as a whole. And that for some it is the first time they have had the unpleasant experience that there are events that neither a leading state nor they themselves can control so easily.</span></p></a>
<a id="S382" spellcheck><h2>Critics are spoiled by affluence</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many who rebel against the pandemic policy are only spoiled by their previous, self-determined lives. And that they therefore do not realize that the changes are due to necessary hygiene and disease control.</span></p></a>
<a id="S383" spellcheck><h2>Leaving the ground of rationality</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that constructive debate is no longer possible with the majority of critics because of their positions. And that therefore the prerequisite for a discourse would be to first return to a rational discussion.</span></p></a>
<a id="S384" spellcheck><h2>Resistance is selfish theater</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the majority of people act rationally, the resistance against the pandemic policy, on the other hand, is only a selfish theater of a minority. And that this minority only elevates the whole thing to a fight for freedom.</span></p></a>
<a id="S385" spellcheck><h2>Resistance is pent-up frustration</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that for many critics the crisis was only the trigger for releasing personally pent-up frustration, which, however, has other, private and social causes. And that in resistance, this frustration can now finally be released.</span></p></a>
<a id="S386" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is not a guarantee</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that nothing has ever been guaranteed with any vaccination and that it is always only a matter of improving probabilities. And that perfect effectiveness exists only in theory.</span></p></a>
<a id="S387" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated have done their duty</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who have had themselves vaccinated have done their social duty. And that opponents of vaccination must now follow suit if they want to continue to claim their social rights.</span></p></a>
<a id="S388" spellcheck><h2>Feelings are not facts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics of the pandemic policy base many of their views on feelings rather than facts. And that political or journalistic balance is difficult when one side sticks to facts and the other only to feelings.</span></p></a>
<a id="S389" spellcheck><h2>Lifetime stolen by the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that due to the unwillingness of the unvaccinated and the consideration of politics for this, parts of their lifetime were stolen from them. And that they now want them back.</span></p></a>
<a id="S390" spellcheck><h2>Hygiene is the basis of civilization</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that hygiene has brought mankind to where it is now in the face of many problems. And that the hygiene measures in the crisis will now also get us out of a major problem.</span></p></a>
<a id="S391" spellcheck><h2>Physical integrity abused</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the principle of physical integrity is appropriated by the critics against vaccination - from where it is really existential. And that the other side - the integrity of the infected - is always ignored.</span></p></a>
<a id="S392" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated fall for quacks</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many unvaccinated people think they can achieve a level of protection equivalent to vaccination by strengthening their immune system. And that in doing so, they listen to all kinds of recommendations from quacks and lull themselves into a false sense of security.</span></p></a>
<a id="S393" spellcheck><h2>Social cohesion is lacking</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the cohesion in this country is broken in the long run. Personally, I have a hard time sitting down at a table with people who let themselves be taken over by the ultra-right, have crazy theories and are simply lacking in solidarity.</span></p></a>
<a id="S394" spellcheck><h2>Acceptance of scientific findings</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that scientific consensus has a higher value than opinions and interpretations. And that devious nonsense cannot be sold as science with the reference to freedom of opinion.</span></p></a>
<a id="S395" spellcheck><h2>Elimination of masks would bring deaths</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if the mask obligation is taken back, we must reckon with thousands of additional deaths. And that among them are mainly vaccinated risk patients and those who are not allowed or not able to be vaccinated through no fault of their own.</span></p></a>
<a id="S396" spellcheck><h2>Too much emphasis on rights</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics place excessive emphasis in their arguments on individual rights and too little on obligations to the social community. And that rights and duties must always be balanced.</span></p></a>
<a id="S397" spellcheck><h2>Corona does not go away from talking</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics should realize that corona is a medical problem, not a sociological one. And that it will not go away from talking and listening, but only through massive and targeted government action.</span></p></a>
<a id="S398" spellcheck><h2>Older generation disappointed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the older generation, to whom we owe a great deal, have developed a great deal of disappointment with the conduct of the &lsquo;I'm against everything&rsquo; faction. And that in the crisis some have lost all respect for old age.</span></p></a>
<a id="S399" spellcheck><h2>Corona can kill the unborn</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that pregnant women wait for the birth out of fear of harming the unborn child before getting vaccinated. And this is not only demonstrably unfounded but also potentially life-threatening for the unborn child.</span></p></a>
<a id="S400" spellcheck><h2>Comparison of victim numbers is clear</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that corona kills and vaccination helps to reduce this danger massively. And that the comparison of the number of how many people have died worldwide by Corona and by vaccination, then any discussion about what is right and what is wrong is unnecessary.</span></p></a>
<a id="S401" spellcheck><h2>It depends on the virus evolution</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the fate of all of us in the next few years depends on the course of the evolution of the coronavirus. And that if the evolution of the virus brings significantly fewer disease-causing variants to predominance, we will be out of the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S402" spellcheck><h2>Not vaccinating is endangering child welfare</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that depriving one's own children of vaccination is a dangerous act that society should not tolerate. And that the state should use its means to take action against parents for endangering the welfare of children.</span></p></a>

<a id="S404" spellcheck><h2>Individuals do not behave reasonably</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one should distance oneself from the idea that individuals behave rationally. And that the state, instead of following this wishful thinking, would do better to relieve individuals of decisions that are important for the community.</span></p></a>
<a id="S405" spellcheck><h2>Still infected shortly before vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many people who fall ill or even die shortly after their vaccination or booster have simply been vaccinated or boosted too late. And that they were infected shortly before the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S406" spellcheck><h2>Individuals do not behave reasonably</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one should distance oneself from the idea that individuals behave rationally. And that the state, instead of following this wishful thinking, would do better to relieve individuals of decisions that are important for the community.</span></p></a>
<a id="S407" spellcheck><h2>Is like ignoring red lights</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that whoever sees controls and tests as state coercion would also have to ignore red traffic lights, since the state uses them to prevent you from driving quickly. And that traffic lights then also have no purpose and if everyone pays attention we can do without it.</span></p></a>
<a id="S408" spellcheck><h2>He is also just an employee</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who enforce measures in the corporate sector, such as in restaurants, are only employees who have to do this. And that one would not seriously want them to lose their jobs because of their own refusal.</span></p></a>
<a id="S409" spellcheck><h2>Get small business owners in trouble</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that by refusing measures such as masks, you are only getting those who have to enforce them into trouble. And that these are usually small entrepreneurs who can't do anything about it.</span></p></a>
<a id="S410" spellcheck><h2>In this case totally understandable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in this particular situation - queue, buffet etc. - it is totally understandable if people have to wear masks. - it is totally understandable if people have to wear masks. And that this should always have been prescribed to protect us all from the pathogens of others.</span></p></a>
<a id="S411" spellcheck><h2>Inconsiderate to the elderly</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that by refusing to take action, one is behaving recklessly and in the worst case could even be directly or indirectly responsible for the death of elderly or immunocompromised people. And that one would not want that after all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S412" spellcheck><h2>Everything is already strongly loosened</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that politics has long since reduced the measures to a barely noticeable level so that we can all live as comfortably as possible. And that the remaining rules are really no reason to rebel.</span></p></a>
<a id="S413" spellcheck><h2>This is good for humanity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is good for mankind to be slowed down by the Corona crisis. And that it should be taken as an impetus to stop overexploiting nature and to focus on sustainable management throughout the world.</span></p></a>
<a id="S414" spellcheck><h2>Doctors vaccinate their own children</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a large part of the physicians have not only vaccinated themselves but also their own children against Corona before the release. And that this is a good indication that one can really assume a meaningful protection with the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S415" spellcheck><h2>We have much bigger problems</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that we humans have much bigger problems than Corona, e.g. climate change, wars, etc. And that people should not demonstrate against harmless Corona measures but instead for the solution of these big problems.</span></p></a>
<a id="S416" spellcheck><h2>Does not want conflicts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they go along with measures such as the mandatory wearing of masks primarily because they don't want to come into conflict with other people. And that this is a much easier way to get through the crisis.</span></p></a>
<a id="S417" spellcheck><h2>Does not want to be registered by the state</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they are critical of one or the other element of Corona's policy, but that they do not go to demonstrations simply because they do not want to be registered by the state. And that it is better to stay under the radar.</span></p></a>
<a id="S418" spellcheck><h2>Anti-vaxxers devalue everything</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the general opposition to any vaccination, whose representatives mingle with the Corona demonstrations, completely devalues the justified criticism of measures. And that one should not go together with such critics on the street.</span></p></a>
<a id="S419" spellcheck><h2>Already gives compulsory vaccinations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that compulsory vaccination against Corona is not a special case, since compulsory vaccinations have long existed. And that this obligation is also well justified with the risk and the danger of the disease.</span></p></a>
<a id="S420" spellcheck><h2>Is bad for all of us</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who are complaining about their own existential limitations due to the measures should be aware that everyone has to make sacrifices. And that this is the only way we can all get out of the crisis together.</span></p></a>
<a id="S421" spellcheck><h2>The children do so beautifully</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the children in the schools and kindergartens nevertheless help with the many solidary measures like masks and distances nevertheless so beautifully to master the crisis. And that one can still have hope for the future of mankind there.</span></p></a>
<a id="S422" spellcheck><h2>Uses right vocabulary</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>in the Corona context, by using politically right-wing vocabulary such as &lsquo;mainstream media&rsquo; or &lsquo;puppets,&rsquo; one makes oneself common with their views and therefore untrustworthy. And that one can also criticize without such references.</span></p></a>
<a id="S423" spellcheck><h2>Personalization of capitalist relations</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that when people like Uğur Şahin or Bill Gates are held personally responsible for exploiting the crisis, this is just a deliberate personalization of the system. And that this simply does not change the capitalist conditions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S424" spellcheck><h2>To make fear was right</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although politics in many places scared the population during the crisis, this approach was the right one. And that without such campaigns, people simply would not have taken the crisis seriously.</span></p></a>
<a id="S425" spellcheck><h2>Omikron BA.2 variant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the omicron variant BA.2 has a fitness advantage and is therefore even more contagious than the original variant. And that we will probably have to fend off this variant for a longer time through targeted measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S426" spellcheck><h2>Children have lost parents</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many children around the world have lost their parents to Corona and are left to fend for themselves. And that the Corona measures are precisely there to prevent such suffering through solidarity.</span></p></a>
<a id="S427" spellcheck><h2>Children contagious without sypmtoms</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that children regularly have the highest incidence levels and can thus become super-spreaders completely without symptoms. And that tests and masks in schools and kindergartens are therefore sensible protective measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S428" spellcheck><h2>Corona can shrink the brain</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that covid infection can cause brain damage. And that in particular the gray matter, which is responsible for emotions and memory, can shrink and the sense of smell can also suffer permanent damage.</span></p></a>
<a id="S429" spellcheck><h2>In previous epidemics, the vaccine would have been welcomed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in past epidemics and pandemics, such as the Spanish flu, people would have welcomed having an effective vaccine. And that people today are simply behaving irrationally when they reject one.</span></p></a>
<a id="S430" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated have higher viral load</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that segregation and unequal treatment of the unvaccinated is justified, since they have a higher viral load in the event of illness. And that they are simply more contagious and therefore more dangerous for their fellow human beings than vaccinated people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S431" spellcheck><h2>Belief in conventional medicine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they have complete trust in conventional medicine when it comes to Corona. And that it simply gives you a good feeling to be treated in case of illness by someone who has gone to &lsquo;school&rsquo;, i.e. has been properly trained.</span></p></a>
<a id="S432" spellcheck><h2>Alternative media are like alternative medicine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that alternative media relate to established media in something like the way alternative medicine relates to conventional medicine. And that alternative media can therefore not be taken seriously, just as homeopathy is not taken seriously.</span></p></a>
<a id="S433" spellcheck><h2>Recombinant threatens</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that we are threatened by a viral recombination of a dangerous and a contagious variant, which can lead to a crisis of even greater proportions. And that we must therefore be careful and not become lax in our protective measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S434" spellcheck><h2>Without measures, there is a risk of contamination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the abolition of measures such as mandatory masks always carries the risk that the coronavirus will spread to large parts of the population. And that we would then have a contamination, which no one can seriously want.</span></p></a>
<a id="S435" spellcheck><h2>You can not fool so many people</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the thesis that we are all being led around by the nose with the virus is simply not comprehensible to them. And that it is completely unrealistic for so many people to be deceived in this way.</span></p></a>
<a id="S436" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to jeopardize my vacation</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they are vaccinated, but still avoid parties and wear masks as often as possible so as not to endanger their upcoming vacation. And that a single positive test can already throw a spanner in the works.</span></p></a>
<a id="S437" spellcheck><h2>If you would only obey, we would all be free</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who oppose the regulations and the vaccinations are to blame for the fact that the situation is not improving. And that if they obeyed, we would have overcome the crisis long ago and would be free again.</span></p></a>
<a id="S438" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not directly responsible</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in people who suffer damage after vaccination, the cause is not the vaccination itself, but existing and undetected previous diseases. And that often an undetected corona infection is also the reason.</span></p></a>
<a id="S439" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to lose my job</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they don't agree with a lot of things, but they can't help but follow their guidelines because they fear for their jobs. And that not everyone can afford to take a critical stance.</span></p></a>
<a id="S440" spellcheck><h2>I only follow my instructions</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in their role they could not help but follow instructions from their employer or supervisor. And that they therefore cannot be held responsible for possible consequences and problems.</span></p></a>
<a id="S441" spellcheck><h2>You do not know with many things what is in it</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the lack of knowledge about ingredients does not only apply to vaccines. In general, no one can say with certainty what is contained in the foods and medications that we consume every day.</span></p></a>
<a id="S442" spellcheck><h2>Bogus correlation due to lack of data</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although mortality rates are partially correlated with vaccination rates, this correlation is only a spurious correlation. And that the available data cannot answer whether vaccinations have a positive or negative effect on deaths.</span></p></a>
<a id="S443" spellcheck><h2>Does not give more heart attacks after vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that statistically the number of heart attacks has not increased. And that therefore claims that vaccination leads to increased heart problems and infarctions are not supported by the figures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S444" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality has other causes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the excess mortality observed worldwide is most likely due to causes other than the vaccination campaign, such as the failure to treat many chronic diseases. And that such false claims only put us all in danger.</span></p></a>
<a id="S445" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine does not destroy the immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the claim that vaccination destroys the immune system is a dangerous misstatement that is not supported by any evidence. And that it makes people abandon the life-saving vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S446" spellcheck><h2>No underreporting of vaccine injuries/deaths</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a claimed high number of unreported cases of vaccine injuries and deaths is not supported by any evidence. And that, due to the existing reporting and assurance procedures, it can be assumed that a large part of the damages and deaths are reported correctly.</span></p></a>
<a id="S447" spellcheck><h2>Was already sick before vaccination</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that people who fall ill with covid or other diseases after vaccination were often already ill before vaccination. And that one can therefore not blame vaccination side effects, because the disease would have broken out anyway.</span></p></a>
<a id="S448" spellcheck><h2>Omicron is other kind of danger</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that with omicron, the ratio of incidences to deaths is different because it is less dangerous and much more contagious. And that this only means that the danger is different, but not that it has been eliminated.</span></p></a>
<a id="S449" spellcheck><h2>Omicron vaccine takes too long</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it will simply take too long before a specific vaccine for the omicron variant is ready for development. And that until then we are only protected with a vaccine that is not very effective, so caution is still the order of the day.</span></p></a>
<a id="S450" spellcheck><h2>Deltacron-Variant</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that a new variant of the coronavirus is spreading, that the dangerousness of the delta variant is combined with the high rate of spread of the omicron variant. And that more measures must be taken against the spread of this variant again.</p></a>
<a id="S451" spellcheck><h2>How many are still protected?</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that due to the decreasing effectiveness of vaccination and the many breakthroughs, it is no longer known how many of those vaccinated are still adequately protected. And that the vaccination rate unfortunately does not provide any precise information.</span></p></a>
<a id="S452" spellcheck><h2>Covid should scare you more</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is irrational to avoid vaccination out of concern for side effects, since the disease and its long-term consequences are much more likely. And that the disease should therefore worry one more than the risk of a vaccination side effect.</span></p></a>
<a id="S453" spellcheck><h2>Long Covid victims are not taken seriously</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many physicians and politicians dismiss widespread Long Covid symptoms such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as imaginary or not Covid-related. And that in this way they try, among other things, to distract from their risky easing policy.</span></p></a>
<a id="S454" spellcheck><h2>Teasing someone about the mask is bullying</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that people who, out of concern for their health, continue to wear masks in spite of the obligation to wear masks, must be respected. And that any kind of exclusion or disparagement of these people is a kind of bullying.</span></p></a>
<a id="S455" spellcheck><h2>If from the lab, then an accident</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if the laboratory origin of the virus were confirmed, its escape was certainly an accident and not a conspiracy. And that a deliberately released pest would have been much more deadly and sophisticated.</span></p></a>
<a id="S456" spellcheck><h2>Wearing masks gives safety</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that wearing masks makes people feel safe, as it leads to less psychological stress because people feel protected and thus have less fear of infection. And that masks thus also indirectly ensure better health for all.</span></p></a>
<a id="S457" spellcheck><h2>Rare allergic reactions treatable</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in very rare cases vaccination can cause an allergic reaction in vaccinated people, but that this is easily treatable, e.g. with an Epipen. And that there is no reason to dismiss people from vaccination with reference to this risk.</span></p></a>
<a id="S458" spellcheck><h2>Sick vaccinated only had bad luck</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that people who got sick with covid despite vaccination were just unlucky. And that such vaccination breakthroughs are possible, for example, due to individually less effective vaccination, but that is the fate of very few people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S459" spellcheck><h2>Healthy unvaccinated people were just lucky</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that unvaccinated persons who have so far been spared infection or have only had a mild course were simply lucky. And that no statement about the usefulness or effectiveness of vaccination can be derived from the existence of this group.</span></p></a>
<a id="S460" spellcheck><h2>The Science is unequivocal</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that the science around corona control is clear and unambiguous. And that there is therefore no acceptable reason to doubt or resist global vaccination as a key pandemic control measure.</p></a>
<a id="S461" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates is also vaccinated</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that Bill Gates, whom some see as the mastermind of a great Corona conspiracy, is himself vaccinated. And that he would not have himself and his children vaccinated if the vaccination represented what the critics claim.</span></p></a>
<a id="S462" spellcheck><h2>Virus forces the measures</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the virus simply forces measures such as lockdowns in its spread pattern once a certain number of cases have been identified. And that politics, advised by scientists, does nothing other than counteract this by enacting appropriate restrictions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S463" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination critics see vaccination damage everywhere</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination critics, in their assumption that vaccination makes people ill, interpret every event and symptom in their vaccinated environment as vaccination damage. And that they completely disregard the fact that people always get sick sometimes.</span></p></a>
<a id="S464" spellcheck><h2>Continue to wear the mask in solidarity</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that even if the mask is no longer mandatory, they continue to wear it to continue to practice solidarity. And that if in this way even one person is spared from the fate of Covid, the effort has already been worthwhile.</span></p></a>
<a id="S465" spellcheck><h2>Some have it in the genes</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that if some people simply don't get infected or get covid, it's because of their good genetic makeup. And that, however, one cannot assume that such a positive fate is given to all people.</span></p></a>
<a id="S466" spellcheck><h2>No effect without side effect</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that medicines also have side effects, because the rule is that what has no side effects has no effect. And that the indignation of vaccinated people about their little problems is therefore inappropriate in the face of our great challenges.</span></p></a>
<a id="S467" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination saves millions of lives</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccination has saved and continues to save millions of lives worldwide, with a very small number of vaccine injuries. And that by making vaccines available in a timely manner, we continue to prevent almost all fatal courses.</span></p></a>
<a id="S468" spellcheck><h2>Shall rejoice in freedom of expression</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics who now publish and discuss the most outlandish theories in social media should be happy about this form of freedom of speech. And that free speech also means having to accept equally loud opposition.</span></p></a>
<a id="S469" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are (mini-)long covid</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that what critics call side effects of vaccination are actually symptoms of a mini Long Covid disease. And that minor Long Covid symptoms can also develop after undetected or mild courses.</span></p></a>
<a id="S470" spellcheck><h2>Errors in vaccination campaigns</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that politicians around the world have made countless mistakes in distributing and rolling out vaccines, which have cost many unnecessary victims. And so that these mistakes are not repeated, vaccination campaigns must be better organized in the future.</span></p></a>
<a id="S471" spellcheck><h2>Spike protein is not the whole virus</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that only a complete virus can force human cells to reproduce. And that, in contrast, mRNA vaccination only ensures the production of harmless spike proteins, which themselves only activate the immune system and do not &lsquo;hijack&rsquo; any cells.</span></p></a>
<a id="S472" spellcheck><h2>Snippet mRNA is harmless</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the mRNA blueprint introduced into the body's cells via inoculation should not cause fear, as it only contains instructions for the production of small spike proteins, but not for a complete virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="S473" spellcheck><h2>A viral infection proceeds exponentially</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the vaccine does not involve an exponential growth of viruses that the immune system has to fight off in time, whereas the vaccine does.</span></p></a>
<a id="S474" spellcheck><h2>Booster vaccine is withheld</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that because the vaccine effect wears off faster than desired, everyone should have access to timely booster vaccinations. And that while there is enough vaccine, it is unfortunately not yet made available for regular booster vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S475" spellcheck><h2>Critical studies usually unserious</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that measures and studies critical of vaccines are usually interest-driven and thus highly dubious. And that opponents of vaccination and enemies of democracy in this way always try to give a scientific veneer to aberrant views.</span></p></a>
<a id="S476" spellcheck><h2>Individual cases are not representative</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that frequently cited anecdotal individual fates of vaccination side effects or even deaths are irrelevant, even if it is one's own fate. And that only statistically clean surveys and evaluations can provide reliable data.</span></p></a>
<a id="S477" spellcheck><h2>Expert conspiracy unrealistic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that it is highly unrealistic that millions of experts of all relevant disciplines from partly hostile countries have conspired with each other to form Corona. And that someone who believes this is difficult to take seriously.</span></p></a>
<a id="S478" spellcheck><h2>People can not handle information</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the majority of people cannot cope with the amount of information and are unable to classify the published figures. And that they now react to critical media reports with mistrust, but used to fully trust their doctor, for example.</span></p></a>
<a id="S479" spellcheck><h2>Prepare for the next winter</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the next winter with another Corona wave is coming in any case and that we have to prepare for it better than before. And that illness and death can best be prevented by early vaccination and boosting, also of children.</span></p></a>
<a id="S480" spellcheck><h2>"Since" is not the same as &lsquo;because&rsquo;!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that &lsquo;since&rsquo; does not mean &lsquo;because,&rsquo; i.e., co-elation is not causation. And that it is very difficult in individual cases to decide whether a supposed side effect is coincidental or causally related to the vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S481" spellcheck><h2>All self-proclaimed experts</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that surveys repeatedly reveal a clear tendency to overestimate oneself, for example when a large majority considers itself to be of above-average intelligence. And that this is now just as true for virological questions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S482" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims would also have fallen ill in the same way</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that anyone who allegedly reacts in a life-threatening manner to the weak &lsquo;virus dose&rsquo; of a vaccination would presumably have become seriously ill in the event of an infection even without vaccination. And that an individual weakness of the vaccination is blamed here.</span></p></a>
<a id="S483" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are normal with new drugs</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that new drugs often still show side effects, but that these are gradually improved via further development of the vaccine. And that side effects were unavoidable in this case in order to react quickly to the spread of the virus.</span></p></a>
<a id="S484" spellcheck><h2>Severity of the side effect subjective</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although the term &lsquo;serious adverse reaction&rsquo; has been defined objectively in scientific terms, subjectively everyone understands it differently (e.g. a sore arm). And that this drives up the number of side effects recorded.</span></p></a>
<a id="S485" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are obliged to report!</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that physicians are required by law to report even the suspicion of harm beyond the usual extent of a vaccination reaction. And that they will therefore do so even in the absence of a financial incentive.</span></p></a>
<a id="S486" spellcheck><h2>There is sufficient open discourse</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the Internet and the media offer sufficient platforms for an open discourse on vaccination and measures. And that, in order to be taken seriously, more than just an expression of opinion based on false facts is required.</span></p></a>
<a id="S487" spellcheck><h2>You can also report side effects yourself</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that complaints about doctors not reporting side effects to their patients can easily be compensated for by those affected making this report themselves online. And that this possibility just has to be used.</span></p></a>
<a id="S488" spellcheck><h2>People believe charlatans</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there is a multitude of charlatans who are also up to their mischief in the Corona environment. And that no matter how often they have been disproved, there will always be people who believe them more than real doctors and scientists.</span></p></a>
<a id="S489" spellcheck><h2>Facts do not help against diffuse fears</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that one of the difficulties of vaccination opponents is that facts do not help against diffuse fears. And that despite many information campaigns on vaccination, the fear of vaccinations and imaginary consequences will probably never be completely conquered.</span></p></a>
<a id="S490" spellcheck><h2>Environmental degradation and pandemics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the diversity of viruses in animals is always looking for new hosts - and that the coronavirus has succeeded in making the leap to humans. And that destructive interventions in nature increase the risk of new pandemics, for example when wild animals come into contact with farm animals.</span></p></a>
<a id="S491" spellcheck><h2>0.6 vs. 0.5 percent in control group</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that critics often cite the 0.6% serious health problems from the Pfizer pivotal study, but often fail to mention that 0.5% serious health problems also occurred in the control group.</p></a>
<a id="S492" spellcheck><h2>Alleged Schwab quote is not one</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the quote &lsquo;You will own nothing and be happy&rsquo; is wrongly attributed to Klaus Schwab, but actually comes from a Danish politician who used it years ago to describe an extreme vision of the &lsquo;share economy&rsquo; for the WEF.</span></p></a>
<a id="S493" spellcheck><h2>Monkey pox shows pandemic threat</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the current outbreak of monkeypox, although less dangerous, shows the pandemic threat we all face. And that it is high time for experts worldwide to agree on general, international pandemic protection mechanisms.</span></p></a>
<a id="S494" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination bias</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many experts who are critical of vaccination are, on closer investigation, close to a clientele that has always been positioned against vaccination. And that their arguments and judgments on vaccination should therefore be treated with great caution.</span></p></a>
<a id="S495" spellcheck><h2>BA.5-Variant in Portugal</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the new Omicron variant BA.5 was able to spread in Portugal because many Corona measures were lifted too early. And that policy makers in other countries should learn from this effect and better maintain their measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S496" spellcheck><h2>Does not want monkey pox</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they themselves have no desire to be infected with monkeypox and therefore expect their policy to act faster and better than before in the event of a new pandemic. And that they will hopefully use the Corona experience to do so.</span></p></a>
<a id="S497" spellcheck><h2>Media prefer negative reports</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the media typically prefer negative and sensational news, as this serves to attract attention and thus their revenues. And that no controlled fear manipulation of the masses in the pandemic context can be derived from this fact.</span></p></a>
<a id="S498" spellcheck><h2>Chain of infection in monkeypox unclear</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in monkeypox the chain of infection is normally traceable, but that this is not the case with the current infections. And that there is a worrying possibility that the virus has changed its transmission characteristics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S499" spellcheck><h2>Charlatans are dangerous</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that in the Corona context, as in other areas, dangerous charlatans are active who promise victims success with alternative treatment methods. And that it is in the interest of the general public that the state puts a stop to them.</span></p></a>
<a id="S500" spellcheck><h2>Who are &lsquo;them up there&rsquo;?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>who are the ominous elites that have engineered this entire crisis and are controlling it from above? And that whoever speaks of central actors without being able to call them by name simply makes himself untrustworthy.</span></p></a>
<a id="S501" spellcheck><h2>What about North Korea?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>how to explain the catastrophic Corona outbreak in North Korea, whose government has so far refused to vaccinate? And that the country's situation shows that isolation alone is not enough to contain the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S502" spellcheck><h2>No mass psychosis</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the crisis is not a matter of mass psychosis or &lsquo;formation&rsquo;, but that pseudo-experts are misusing inappropriate terms from psychology for their own interests. And that such critics should not be given any publicity.</span></p></a>
<a id="S503" spellcheck><h2>Virus is imported again through travel</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although the spread of the virus is improving in their own country, the virus is constantly being imported in new variants due to increasing global travel. And that therefore politics must take the lead through regulations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S504" spellcheck><h2>SADS has always existed</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the diagnosis of sudden, unexplained cardiac death has been around for a long time and has nothing to do with the current Corona situation or the vaccination campaigns. And that corresponding claims with reference to statistical figures are misinformation.</span></p></a>
<a id="S505" spellcheck><h2>Algorithms make extremists</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that social media algorithms, which are typically designed to keep people online, bring them into contact with increasingly extreme views in the Corona context. And that they then end up irredeemably in the Telegram bubble.</span></p></a>
<a id="S506" spellcheck><h2>Firmware update for the immune system</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>I believe that vaccinations can be viewed like a firmware update for the immune system. And that if the old one still has errors, you simply add a new update with a booster and at some point everything works and the pandemic is overcome.</span></p></a>
<a id="S507" spellcheck><h2>Is due to heat and climate change</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that heart problems and heart attacks can be explained by climate change, since excessive heat can overload the human body. And that here often predisposed people become victims, who already carry certain heart disease risks in themselves.</span></p></a>
<a id="S508" spellcheck><h2>Is due to dehydration</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that thromboses, heart problems, and heart attacks can often be explained by dehydration, since people typically do not drink enough. And that there are usually simpler explanations than claimed vaccine side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S509" spellcheck><h2>Is due to the psychological stress</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that heart problems and attacks in the pandemic era often have psychosomatic causes such as financial worries or additional stresses from home schooling. And that there are usually simpler explanations than claimed vaccine side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S510" spellcheck><h2>Is due to solar storms</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that so-called solar storms, which occur in cycles, can not only cause technical malfunctions but also increase the risk of heart disease. And that this is another possible explanation for claimed vaccine side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S511" spellcheck><h2>Is due to pollution</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that pollution of air, water and soil is responsible for millions of deaths each year, manifesting as strokes, heart attacks or chronic heart disease. And that some mistakenly think of these as vaccine side effects.</span></p></a>
<a id="S512" spellcheck><h2>Virtually the same vaccine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that vaccines adapted to new variants function according to the same procedure and that only individual elements have been exchanged. And that therefore the renunciation of new admission studies is meaningful, in order to bring us faster from the pandemic.</span></p></a>
<a id="S513" spellcheck><h2>Preference for hearsay</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that many people base their decisions on hearsay and second-hand information rather than on sound scientific data. And that this is not the way to get the dangerousness of the situation into people's heads via the media.</span></p></a>
<a id="S514" spellcheck><h2>Why critical here in particular?</h2>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>why someone is so critical of the new Corona vaccines, which could save the lives of millions of people. And that with other drugs and therapies, studies and ingredients were not asked first.</span></p></a>
<a id="S515" spellcheck><h2>With freedom comes responsibility</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that with every freedom always comes a corresponding responsibility. And that the problem is that some people want one without the other, although balance between the two is the ideal for a society.</span></p></a>
<a id="S516" spellcheck><h2>Tested and proven</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although the vaccines made available worldwide were developed and used in a very short time, it can now be deduced from their successful use alone that they are a tested and proven product.</span></p></a>
<a id="S517" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated in hospital unfair</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that not vaccinating and then expecting the same care in case of illness as vaccinated people is unfair to the hospital staff. And that these people are not only physically but also emotionally overburdened.</span></p></a>
<a id="S518" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated less dangerous for others</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that those who are vaccinated usually have only mild symptoms or none at all. And that people without symptoms have a lower viral load themselves, hardly sneeze or cough and thus hardly excrete the virus via aerosols or droplets.</span></p></a>
<a id="S519" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated do not live long enough for studies</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that studies showing, for example, overcrowding of hospitals with vaccinated individuals distort reality because unvaccinated individuals simply do not live long enough to still participate in this type of survey.</p></a>
<a id="S520" spellcheck><h2>Simply signs of age</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>I have been told that her difficulties in climbing stairs and walking have nothing to do with the vaccination (or Long Covid), but are simply an expected sign of old age. You get old slowly and you can no longer expect everything from your body.</span></p></a>
<a id="S521" spellcheck><h2>Simply a matter of conscience</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that their conscience simply does not allow them to violate distance, masking and social distancing rules. And that no one would want to make their family, friends and people in general sick through unreasonable actions.</span></p></a>
<a id="S522" spellcheck><h2>Access to vaccines a privilege</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that timely and early access to tested vaccines adapted to current virus variants is a great privilege reserved mainly for developed countries. And that this awareness is unfortunately not present in many.</span></p></a>
<a id="S523" spellcheck><h2>Extremes lead to nothing good</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that striving for extremes, e.g. the complete freedom of the individual, always leads to a deterioration for a society. And that it is always about rational decisions that take into account human emancipation and solidarity.</span></p></a>
<a id="S524" spellcheck><h2>Nuremberg Code abused</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics of mass vaccination falsely place it in the context of the Nuremberg Code as a forced medical mass experiment. And that there can be no question of this in the case of an urgently needed, comprehensively tested vaccine.</span></p></a>
<a id="S525" spellcheck><h2>False Balance Problem</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that when mass media tries to reflect a diversity of opinions, a false balance quickly emerges in which views appear more relevant to the reader than they are. And that this is increasingly the case with views of Corona critics in particular.</span></p></a>
<a id="S526" spellcheck><h2>Abolish licensing bureaucracy</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that progress in medicines is being held back worldwide by regulatory bureaucracy. And that the use of medicines like vaccines should simply be left to the free market and individual choice.</span></p></a>
<a id="S527" spellcheck><h2>Safety rules are undermined</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that increasingly lax handling of safety rules, for example in public transportation or air travel, is undermining protective structures. And that this not only puts people in danger but can also provoke new waves of the Covid disease.</span></p></a>
<a id="S528" spellcheck><h2>More than a severe cold</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a coronavirus infection is often mistakenly equated by critics with a severe cold. And that this virus, however, is more dangerous, as it is demonstrably triggers more than just cold symptoms.</span></p></a>
<a id="S529" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination reduces the risk of infection</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a current vaccination does not protect 100% against infection, but already reduces the risk of infection significantly. And that it therefore makes a lot of sense to keep your vaccination status up to date as long as virus variants are still circulating.</span></p></a>
<a id="S530" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects against severe courses</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that even with a vaccination you can still get sick and even end up in hospital, but that it protects you from serious illnesses. And that it therefore makes a lot of sense to regularly update your vaccinations.</span></p></a>
<a id="S531" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination reduces long covid risk</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that even with vaccination it is possible to fall ill with corona to such an extent that one retains Long Covid symptoms, but that the risk of this is significantly reduced with vaccination. And that it can therefore not hurt a current vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S532" spellcheck><h2>Omicron BQ.1.1</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that a new Omicron variant is spreading rapidly, which is both contagious like Omicron and again as dangerous as the Delta variant. And that therefore there is no other option than to impose comprehensive protective measures again.</span></p></a>
<a id="S533" spellcheck><h2>Twindemic</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that with the Corona pandemic, influenza also poses a greater threat, for which, fortunately, there are also up-to-date vaccinations. And that in the worst case we are threatened with a Twindemic in the winter, in which both Corona and influenza are rampant.</span></p></a>
<a id="S534" spellcheck><h2>Studien-Cherrypicking</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that critics are sometimes able to substantiate their positions with convincing studies, but that this is mainly due to the fact that they select suitable papers. And that a balanced scientific approach would produce completely different results.</span></p></a>
<a id="S535" spellcheck><h2>Fortunately it was not Delta</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they are very happy that they have Corona, but only the less dangerous Omicron variant, not the initially present Delta variant. And that</span></p></a>
<a id="S536" spellcheck><h2>Depression symptoms in many cases</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there is a correlation between Long Covid symptoms and depression. And that depression symptoms such as listlessness, fatigue or concentration problems are sometimes wrongly interpreted as late effects of a covid infection.</span></p></a>
<a id="S537" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated people expected in hospital</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the apparently unusually high proportion of vaccinated patients with covid in the hospital is actually to be expected, since the elderly and the previously ill were vaccinated at a higher rate and naturally tend to end up there as high-risk patients. And that even despite vaccination.</span></p></a>
<a id="S538" spellcheck><h2>From Corona denier to Putin fan</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>I am surprised that many self-proclaimed critics have seamlessly taken their aggressive ignorance of reality from the Corona topic to the Ukraine topic, and are now also bragging about their deviant views here. And that after the anti-mainstream you can already set the clock.</span></p></a>
<a id="S539" spellcheck><h2>Mask less unpleasant than late effects</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that the temporary wearing of a mask, e.g. in public transport, is far less unpleasant than the possibly lifelong, agonizing late effects of an infection. And that one therefore simply does not understand why the critics are opposed to this.</span></p></a>
<a id="S540" spellcheck><h2>Boosters as a health routine</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that anyone who doesn't find the prospect of concentration problems, muscle, joint and limb pain, lassitude and shortness of breath attractive should go for a booster as soon as possible. And that this booster should become a health routine.</span></p></a>
<a id="S541" spellcheck><h2>Standing before the era of pandemics</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that there will soon be combinations of different viruses and that an infection with them would probably result in a high death rate. And that the probability of this is so high that we are threatened with a whole era of pandemics.</span></p></a>
<a id="S542" spellcheck><h2>Sometimes glad about the mask requirement</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they are sometimes that there is a mask duty in certain places, e.g. in narrow waiting rooms or crowded public transport. And that without the duty you would have to argue with other people about mutual protection.</span></p></a>
<a id="S543" spellcheck><h2>I like to wear the mask</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that they now like wearing the mask because it gives them the good feeling that they are protecting their loved ones. And that it is still a comparatively unproblematic and easy-to-implement protection compared to other measures.</span></p></a>
<a id="S544" spellcheck><h2>External protection is and was given</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> <span>that although external protection by vaccination was not scientifically investigated at the beginning of the campaign, it can now be assumed to have been proven after many years of practical experience. And that critics only play up this aspect.</span></p></a>
