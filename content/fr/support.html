Aside from making sound fun of the either/or division that many people think is real these days, this little app has big things in store: It wants to build bridges, create awareness and knowledge. It is for people who really want to deal with the arguments of the other side of the discourse. It wants to make sure that people approach each other again. It wants to be a valuable source and enable an open and well-founded exchange.
</p><p>
The contents of this app - like our reality - are in constant flux. New arguments are added regularly and others become irrelevant. In addition, there are arguments that are used worldwide (the common core) and arguments only used and understood locally. For keeping this up to date, your support is very welcome!
