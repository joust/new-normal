<h1>The<i> Idiots</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="I1" spellcheck><h2>Immune system?</h2>
<p>Our immune system protects us against viruses. If we didn't have one, God would have made us come into the world with an everyday mask.</p></a>
<a id="I2" spellcheck><h2>PCR test not validated</h2>
<p>All PCR test products that are used are not validated at all and therefore not approved for diagnostic / clinical use. This is even stated on the package inserts.</p></a>
<a id="I3" spellcheck><h2>PCR test only with symptoms</h2>
<p>If at all, PCR tests are only useful in sick people (with symptoms) to find out if the virus is involved. In healthy individuals, the error rate would be far too high!</p></a>
<a id="I4" spellcheck><h2>100 different PCR tests</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of PCR test products from different manufacturers, all of which work differently and provide different results. You can always test for the result you need!</p></a>
<a id="I5" spellcheck><h2>Fundamental rights</h2>
<p>The reason why fundamental rights are called that is because they cannot be overridden. All the ordinances that are currently being used to do this are contrary to the Basic Law and will not stand up in court.</p></a>
<a id="I6" spellcheck><h2>Like in the 1930s</h2>
<p>Our society is sliding into totalitarianism similar to the 1930s. We 'sheep' are letting this happen to us just as our 'great-grand sheep' did back then.</p></a>
<a id="I7" spellcheck><h2>Disinfectants useless</h2>
<p>Many disinfectants are only effective against bacteria, but not against viruses (virucidal). And if the exposure time is insufficient, they have no effect at all.</p></a>
<a id="I8" spellcheck><h2>Masks of no use</h2>
<p>Almost all available scientific studies question the effectiveness of masks. These studies are ignored or even suppressed.</p></a>
<a id="I9" spellcheck><h2>Mask harmful</h2>
<p>Wearing masks for prolonged periods of time leads to an undersupply of oxygen, which is harmful to the body. This leads to permanent damage such as the death of brain cells!</p></a>
<a id="I10" spellcheck><h2>Illness- and suicide-rates</h2>
<p>Measures with economic effects, especially lockdowns, drive people into hardship, into viral and existential fear and into loneliness. Rates of illness and suicide multiply as a result.</p></a>
<a id="I11" spellcheck><h2>Measures worldwide fatal</h2>
<p>The measures to contain the virus claim many more victims than the virus itself. Billions of people worldwide are threatened with the loss of their livelihoods!</p></a>
<a id="I12" spellcheck><h2>Depopulation plans</h2>
<p>Lockdowns are fatal and lead to the starvation and death of hundreds of millions of people. This fits in with the plans of elite circles to drastically reduce the world's population for the good of us all.</p></a>
<a id="I13" spellcheck><h2>Printing money dangerous</h2>
<p>All those who are now destitute due to the measures and have to be alimented will do so with freshly printed money. This makes everyone's economic future unpredictable.</p></a>
<a id="I14" spellcheck><h2>Great Reset</h2>
<p>According to the official Great Reset plans of the World Economic Forum, the crisis is the vehicle for a hard reboot of globalized capitalism. This has even been addressed by Grobi on the US Sesame Street.</p></a>
<a id="I15" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates no physician</h2>
<p>Bill Gates, as a pharmaceutical lobbyist, has not been elected by anyone to decide the medical fate of all mankind. With his corrupt practices, he has only moved from the software business to another.</p></a>
<a id="I16" spellcheck><h2>Children suffer</h2>
<p>Children are frightened, traumatized and massively impaired in their development by measures such as mandatory masks in daycare centers and schools. This is completely disproportionate.</p></a>
<a id="I17" spellcheck><h2>Look to Australia</h2>
<p>In the Australian state of Victoria, local politics combined a drastic lockdown with curfews and full surveillance of the population. Not even demonstrating was possible legally anymore.</p></a>
<a id="I18" spellcheck><h2>Parliamentary reservation</h2>
<p>All decisions that are of substantial weight for the community must be decided in parliament. This must apply in particular to measures and new regulations.</p></a>
<a id="I19" spellcheck><h2>Threat of fascism</h2>
<p>One can observe a strong appropriation of power by the executive worldwide. According to Adorno, one must therefore fear the return of fascism in the guise of democracy!</p></a>
<a id="I20" spellcheck><h2>Socialism remake</h2>
<p>The state's arbitrary measures and the lack of explanations for their plausibility seem like a new edition of earlier real-socialist regimes. This is matched by the coercive enforcement by an overreaching executive.</p></a>
<a id="I21" spellcheck><h2>Scientific discourse</h2>
<p>There are also countless scientists who have a completely different view of the usefulness of measures and the dangerousness of the virus. These must be included in the public discourse.</p></a>
<a id="I22" spellcheck><h2>Positive test not disease</h2>
<p>Neither a positive PCR test can prove an infection nor a disease, only symptoms allow such a diagnosis. The use of these terms in the media is incorrect and misleading.</p></a>
<a id="I23" spellcheck><h2>Viruses do not exist</h2>
<p>It is a valid scientific position that there are no viruses at all, and that the effects attributed to them actually result from endogenous exosomes!</p></a>
<a id="I24" spellcheck><h2>Flatten the Curve?!</h2>
<p>We have long since stopped using the utilization of our hospitals as a yardstick, but rather an arbitrary number of positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants. This figure no longer allows us to say anything about the real risk.</p></a>
<a id="I25" spellcheck><h2>Not without us!</h2>
<p>In barely transparent and unelected structures, decisions are made on how the entire world is to be 'rebooted'. Those who have to bear the brunt of this should have a say in the matter.</p></a>
<a id="I26" spellcheck><h2>infection fatality rate 0.x%</h2>
<p>According to many studies, the infection mortality IFR is about the same for the novel virus as for the influenza virus. Therefore, it is not an increased risk to the general public.</p></a>
<a id="I27" spellcheck><h2>Mild Flu</h2>
<p>The novel virus is about the same as a medium-sized flu. Therefore, it does not pose an increased risk to the vast majority of the population.</p></a>
<a id="I28" spellcheck><h2>PCR-Tests Big business</h2>
<p>PCR testing is a billion-dollar business for many pharmaceutical companies. These profits are out of all proportion to the benefits for all of us.</p></a>
<a id="I29" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines Big business</h2>
<p>Vaccines are a low-risk business worth billions for pharmaceutical companies. In an interview, Bill Gates himself estimated the return on investment at a staggering 20 times.</p></a>
<a id="I30" spellcheck><h2>Censorship</h2>
<p>Information contradicting the official description of the virus exists, but is censored by the media. This gives the population a false impression.</p></a>
<a id="I31" spellcheck><h2>Manipulation</h2>
<p>Much of the information communicated in the official Corona story is manipulated. Those who fall for it handle information too uncritically.</p></a>
<a id="I32" spellcheck><h2>Media spreads fear</h2>
<p>Our leading media strongly tend to stir up disproportionate fears in the population. These fears lead to a strong increase of anxiety disorders and suicides!</p></a>
<a id="I33" spellcheck><h2>No excess mortality</h2>
<p>Globally, there is no excess mortality at all on an annual average. This means that the risk of death has not changed compared to previous years.</p></a>
<a id="I34" spellcheck><h2>No Flu any more</h2>
<p>Since Corona victims have been recorded, hardly any victims of influenza or flu-like infections have been recorded statistically. This suggests that a reinterpretation of these victims is taking place.</p></a>
<a id="I35" spellcheck><h2>Age mortality</h2>
<p>Worldwide, the average age at death of virus victims is the same as the usual local age mortality. In some cases, it does not even take a positive test to be counted as a corona victim.</p></a>
<a id="I36" spellcheck><h2>Swine flu</h2>
<p>All of what we are experiencing right now already happened like this 10 years ago with the swine flu, even with the same actors! At that time it was exposed as an expensive lobby piece of the pharmaceutical industry.</p></a>
<a id="I37" spellcheck><h2>Knows no one</h2>
<p>Because I don't know anyone in my circle of acquaintances who has become seriously ill or died from the virus, it can't be the 'killer virus' it is thought to be.</p></a>
<a id="I38" spellcheck><h2>Sweden successful</h2>
<p>Sweden, despite having only made recommendations to its citizens, is now better off than the rest of the world. This is a clear indication that the measures imposed elsewhere have not brought any improvement.</p></a>
<a id="I39" spellcheck><h2>Great Barrington Declaration</h2>
<p>There are tens of thousands of scientists and physicians who demand completely different measures but are not being heard. Their position can be read in the "Great Barrington Declaration".</p></a>
<a id="I40" spellcheck><h2>Central Bank Digital Currency</h2>
<p>While we are busy with the virus, a digital central bank currency (CBDC) is being realized in the background, with which we will soon all have to pay. With this, the possibility to pay anonymously disappears!</p></a>
<a id="I41" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic criteria lowered</h2>
<p>During the swine flu crisis staged by the pharmaceutical industry in 2009, the WHO criteria for a pandemic were lowered. It was this circumstance that made the current declaration as a pandemic possible.</p></a>
<a id="I42" spellcheck><h2>WHO = Big Pharma</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization is not an independent institution that cares for all of our well-being. It is funded and controlled by pharmaceutical companies with profit interests.</p></a>
<a id="I43" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates controls ...</h2>
<p>Bill Gates and his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the trust of the same name provide pharmaceutical companies with high profits under the guise of philanthropy. This is one of the reasons for the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I44" spellcheck><h2>Wrong intensive treatment</h2>
<p>The treatment of many patients seriously ill with the virus with ventilators is wrong and even increases mortality. The simple administration of oxygen has been shown to be more successful.</p></a>
<a id="I45" spellcheck><h2>Autopsies</h2>
<p>Without an autopsy, it is usually impossible to determine which respiratory virus or other disease caused a patient's death. Worldwide, the positive test alone is the basis for the declaration as a corona death.</p></a>
<a id="I46" spellcheck><h2>WITH not FROM the virus</h2>
<p>It is not at all clear how many of the virus victims died FROM and how many only WITH the virus. Testing for a single virus cannot determine that either.</p></a>
<a id="I47" spellcheck><h2>No asymptomatic transmission</h2>
<p>According to many studies, transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers is practically non-existent. The measures prescribed for healthy individuals are therefore superfluous.</p></a>
<a id="I48" spellcheck><h2>PLANdemic</h2>
<p>The pandemic must actually be called a PLANdemic, because it was obviously prepared for a long time. There are countless, well-documented indications of this.</p></a>
<a id="I49" spellcheck><h2>Event 201</h2>
<p>The October 2019 pandemic exercise 'Event 201' was close to the outbreak of the pandemic. It is a key indication that we are dealing with a planned event.</p></a>
<a id="I50" spellcheck><h2>Intensive beds normal</h2>
<p>An increasing number of occupied intensive care beds is normal for the cold season and shows up like this every year. The figures are intentionally not presented in the context of previous years.</p></a>
<a id="I51" spellcheck><h2>Test pandemic only</h2>
<p>The second wave is only a 'test pandemic' because neither the occupancy of intensive care beds nor the number of deaths follows the increase in positive tests. In many countries, these values are even opposite.</p></a>
<a id="I52" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns kill!</h2>
<p>Excess mortality peaks worldwide have their cause in the imposition of measures such as lockdowns and not in the virus event! This can also be proven statistically.</p></a>
<a id="I53" spellcheck><h2>Immune System not a Topic</h2>
<p>Before the crisis, strengthening the immune system was an important topic in the media during the cold season. Now, in the Corona period, strangely enough, it no longer plays a role.</p></a>
<a id="I54" spellcheck><h2>False positive rate high</h2>
<p>At low prevalence - spread of the virus - mass testing of healthy individuals has an exorbitantly high false positive rate. The test procedure negatively influences the result here.</p></a>
<a id="I55" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccines dangerous</h2>
<p>mRNA vaccines, such as those now to be used en masse against the virus, have never been approved before. Nothing can be known about the long-term consequences.</p></a>
<a id="I56" spellcheck><h2>Forced vaccination comes</h2>
<p>There will be no way around vaccination because, although in many places it will not be compulsory, the pressure will be very great. Without vaccination, many things will be denied (e.g. travel, culture).</p></a>
<a id="I57" spellcheck><h2>Youtube deletes</h2>
<p>Youtube massively deletes critical videos on the topic of viruses and blocks users, demonetarizes and shadow-bans. The only thing that matters is whether the content is on the official line.</p></a>
<a id="I58" spellcheck><h2>Hyper inflation is coming</h2>
<p>The large amount of money that is currently being distributed worldwide in industrialized nations to prop up the losers of the crisis increases the risk of hyperinflation.</p></a>
<a id="I59" spellcheck><h2>Hearing other experts</h2>
<p>There are countless experts who see the current virus crisis through completely different eyes. Their competence is just as relevant as that of the experts who follow the official narrative.</p></a>
<a id="I60" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects known</h2>
<p>The Corona vaccines, developed in a rush, have already led to severe side effects and deaths in the radically shortened test phases. It is irresponsible to use them for mass vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I61" spellcheck><h2>World government</h2>
<p>There are open plans to centralize government power in the next few years as the virus crisis unfolds. We are heading toward an authoritarian, technocratic, and unelected world government.</p></a>
<a id="I62" spellcheck><h2>Democracy at its end</h2>
<p>Our democratic order is in great danger as a result of the crisis and, in particular, as a result of the measures imposed. At present, it is not clear when the state of emergency with the suspension of fundamental rights will be reversed.</p></a>
<a id="I63" spellcheck><h2>Insolvency of Capitalism</h2>
<p>Globalized, neoliberal turbo-capitalism has again reached the end of its cycle. Its collapse is just being disguised by the viral crisis and delayed for the benefit of the elites.</p></a>
<a id="I64" spellcheck><h2>Hundreds of other viruses</h2>
<p>Besides Sars-Cov-2, there are hundreds of other respiratory viruses with comparable symptoms. Since an organism is usually affected by several at the same time, testing for exactly one of them is hardly meaningful.</p></a>
<a id="I65" spellcheck><h2>Listen to critics, too</h2>
<p>Listening to science would require acknowledging scientific contradictions and making scientific discourse visible to the public and the media. Anything else is unscientific.</p></a>
<a id="I66" spellcheck><h2>Treatment long available</h2>
<p>Several even inexpensive treatments for COVID have long been available. However, no money can be made with them and therefore they are concealed or even discredited.</p></a>
<a id="I67" spellcheck><h2>Forced digitization</h2>
<p>In the wake of the virus crisis, the digital economy is getting a strong boost. It will radically reshape our world toward a technocracy with digital identity solutions combined with immunity badges.</p></a>
<a id="I68" spellcheck><h2>Protect risk groups</h2>
<p>It would make much more sense if not all healthy people took measures for external protection, but only the risk groups took measures for self-protection. Many epidemiologists and immunologists also see it that way.</p></a>
<a id="I69" spellcheck><h2>No Pandemic</h2>
<p>The statistical excess mortality is not different than in the last years. We are therefore dealing neither with an epidemic situation nor with a medical crisis!</p></a>
<a id="I70" spellcheck><h2>Flu season every year</h2>
<p>During the flu season, the number of respiratory illnesses increases sharply every year, overloading hospitals. What we are experiencing now is not a special situation.</p></a>
<a id="I71" spellcheck><h2>Crisis substitute for war</h2>
<p>The crisis is met intentionally with unsuitable measures in order to destroy as much as possible like in a war. Capitalism has always rehabilitated itself in this way!</p></a>
<a id="I72" spellcheck><h2>ct value not standardized</h2>
<p>It is not specified above which threshold of the ct value determined in the PCR test - the multiplication cycles as a measure of the viral load - the test is considered positive. This means that it can be abused for any political purpose.</p></a>
<a id="I73" spellcheck><h2>Use your brain!</h2>
<p>One should not be put into fear and apathy by the media but use his mind to evaluate the openly available information himself. Then one comes to other conclusions!</p></a>
<a id="I74" spellcheck><h2>Wake up!</h2>
<p>Anyone who has not yet noticed that a false game is being played here can no longer be saved. Everyone can now know where they would have stood in Germany even in the 1930s.</p></a>
<a id="I75" spellcheck><h2>Herd immunity</h2>
<p>Herd immunity is not a strategy but simply a fact. Herd immunity has probably long been achieved in most countries.</p></a>
<a id="I76" spellcheck><h2>T-cell immunity</h2>
<p>We do not need to be vaccinated on a large scale because a large part of the population already has basic T-cell immunity from similar viruses. The pharmaceutical industry suppresses this information.</p></a>
<a id="I77" spellcheck><h2>Filter bubble</h2>
<p>People who rely on the mass media for information about the virus are in a filter bubble. This information bubble massively distorts their perception of reality.</p></a>
<a id="I78" spellcheck><h2>Financial incentives</h2>
<p>In many countries, case numbers and ICU bed occupancy are driven up by financial incentives/ flat rates. There is more money to be made from both positively tested patients and dead people!</p></a>
<a id="I79" spellcheck><h2>Milgram Experiment</h2>
<p>We are in the middle of a huge, unprecedented human experiment. It is similar to the terrifying Milgram experiment, which tested the effect of authority on people.</p></a>
<a id="I80" spellcheck><h2>Healthcare was Cut Back</h2>
<p>The politics before Corona weakened the health care system in different ways and so overcharges are nothing special anymore. Since the beginning of the crisis, nothing has been changed!</p></a>
<a id="I81" spellcheck><h2>Dark Winter</h2>
<p>That next winter will go by the name of 'Dark Winter' for the 'planners' of this crisis, and that we will have to brace ourselves for many more planned deprivations!</p></a>
<a id="I82" spellcheck><h2>Pressure from above?</h2>
<p>There are indications that national and international politicians and officials receive pressure 'from above', e.g. from the IMF, to implement harmful measures. Apparently, examples have already been made of some deviants!</p></a>
<a id="I83" spellcheck><h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p>Studies show that vitamin&nbsp;D deficiency significantly worsens the course and COVID diseases. The administration of vitamin&nbsp;D alone promises massive success in prevention and treatment!</p></a>
<a id="I84" spellcheck><h2>Fact checkers biased</h2>
<p>Many fact-checkers on the Corona topic are not guided by truth at all, but by interests and prejudices. They are therefore the real equivalent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's '1984'!</p></a>
<a id="I85" spellcheck><h2>People always die</h2>
<p>Death is the only certainty in life. A painful death, as is regularly reported in the media in connection with Corona, was also the order of the day before Corona.</p></a>
<a id="I86" spellcheck><h2>Postponed OPs</h2>
<p>Around the world, millions of scheduled surgeries are canceled and people forgo medical exams and treatments. This leads to much more premature suffering and death.</p></a>
<a id="I87" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns ineffective</h2>
<p>Measures such as lockdowns and school closures have no effect on corona infectivity. In contrast, they are causing more and more suffering and death in other areas.</p></a>
<a id="I88" spellcheck><h2>Staying Alive not Living</h2>
<p>We lose sight of life for survival. The measures currently imposed, such as lockdowns and curfews, falsely suggest that survival equals life.</p></a>
<a id="I89" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine there too fast</h2>
<p>In the context of the timing of the crisis, the development of the mRNA vaccines was started much too early and was successful too quickly. This indicates prior knowledge and must be critically examined!</p></a>
<a id="I90" spellcheck><h2>1984</h2>
<p>The current situation is very reminiscent of the dystopia '1984' by George Orwell. This was certainly not intended by the author as a template or guide!</p></a>
<a id="I91" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination senseless</h2>
<p>Vaccination currently makes little sense, since its effectiveness is not assured and those already infected do not need vaccination at all. It does not bring us any closer to normalizing our lives.</p></a>
<a id="I92" spellcheck><h2>Guinea Pigs</h2>
<p>The inadequate testing of the vaccines, their forced fast-track approval, and the side effects already known can only lead to the conclusion that mass vaccination is an irresponsible human experiment.</p></a>
<a id="I93" spellcheck><h2>Not about health</h2>
<p>Our policy is neither about our health nor about the health care system as a whole. Otherwise, they should have acted very differently, both now and in the past decades!</p></a>
<a id="I94" spellcheck><h2>Artists stand up</h2>
<p>More and more artists are reflecting on their role as critical commentators of our world. Eric Clapton and Van Morrison are particularly noteworthy!</p></a>
<a id="I95" spellcheck><h2>Herd Immunity Criteria</h2>
<p>In the course of the Corona vaccinations, the WHO has changed its definition of herd immunity so that natural immunity no longer has any meaning, i.e. it can only be achieved by vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I96" spellcheck><h2>First vaccination victims</h2>
<p>There are already vaccination victims who are hardly discussed in the mass media. Given the haste with which vaccines were developed and tested, this was to be expected.</p></a>
<a id="I97" spellcheck><h2>We all get chipped</h2>
<p>The final goal of introducing a global vaccination regime is to bring all people under control via microchips. This will also be achieved by seamless networking with 5G.</p></a>
<a id="I98" spellcheck><h2>Won't go away</h2>
<p>Corona has long had to be regarded as just another of the many infectious diseases that we humans have to live with. There are no measures to make it disappear again.</p></a>
<a id="I99" spellcheck><h2>Oath of Hippocrates</h2>
<p>According to Hippocrates' oath, physicians undertake not to harm their patients (Primum non nocere). For this reason alone, they must reject the measures on the basis of their harmfulness.</p></a>
<a id="I100" spellcheck><h2>My Body my Choice</h2>
<p>Every individual has the right to freely decide about his or her body. This freedom of choice is once again in danger with the Corona vaccination regime.</p></a>
<a id="I101" spellcheck><h2>Virus from the Lab</h2>
<p>There are many serious indications that the virus was produced in the laboratory. In the context of 'gain of function' research, viruses have long been deliberately made more dangerous.</p></a>
<a id="I102" spellcheck><h2>AutoImmune overreaction</h2>
<p>After vaccination, there is a risk of a life-threatening overreaction of the immune system on contact with the real pathogen. As a result, many vaccinated people will become unintentional victims in the future.</p></a>
<a id="I103" spellcheck><h2>Infertility</h2>
<p>The spike protein permanently generated in the body after mRNA vaccination may have an influence on reproduction. Therefore, the risk of infertility cannot be excluded.</p></a>
<a id="I104" spellcheck><h2>Allergic reactions</h2>
<p>Certain components of the vaccines can trigger life-threatening reactions in allergy sufferers. You should be free to decide for or against vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I105" spellcheck><h2>Risk of genetic alterations</h2>
<p>The mRNA administered with the vaccines could be incorporated into the human genome. This effect has long been known in the genetic modification of plants via transgenes.</p></a>
<a id="I106" spellcheck><h2>Not a true placebo</h2>
<p>The placebo administered to the comparison group in vaccine test runs typically also contains most of the components of the vaccine. The results are thus deliberately falsified.</p></a>
<a id="I107" spellcheck><h2>How do you tell your children?</h2>
<p>Do you realize what a dystopian future you are leaving to your own children and grandchildren through inaction? What will you answer them when they ask why you allowed this to happen?</p></a>
<a id="I108" spellcheck><h2>What about Belarus?</h2>
<p>Belarus decided against lockdowns and other measures, contrary to IMF requirements. Everyday life there has continued as normal and no medical crisis has broken out.</p></a>
<a id="I109" spellcheck><h2>Recession already here</h2>
<p>The greatest recession of modern times is already in full swing. This damage has not been caused by the virus but by inappropriate political decisions worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I110" spellcheck><h2>Double Standards</h2>
<p>The many double standards, something for sports, the police, the railroads and the airplane are an unmistakable sign of comprehensive deception. You just have to take a close look!</p></a>
<a id="I111" spellcheck><h2>Good and bad protests</h2>
<p>The state authorities around the world obviously intervene above all in unwelcome demonstrations when they allege violations of distance and masking requirements. In doing so, they expose themselves.</p></a>
<a id="I112" spellcheck><h2>Virus Patents</h2>
<p>Not only has research on coronaviruses been going on for years with government support, but there are even patents on virus variants already. These are held by US government organizations!</p></a>
<a id="I113" spellcheck><h2>It's not a vaccine</h2>
<p>'Vaccine' is a legally defined term in public health law. mRNA that makes human cells produce pathogens does not fall under this definition - and makes it illegal!</p></a>
<a id="I114" spellcheck><h2>Füllmich sues ...</h2>
<p>A worldwide team of lawyers around consumer protection lawyer Rainer Füllmich will soon end the crisis by bringing all responsible parties to court worldwide!</p></a>
<a id="I115" spellcheck><h2>Third Wave is the Jab</h2>
<p>There are countless indications that people often test positive for the virus directly after vaccination, fall ill and even die. In this way, you can also create a new wave.</p></a>
<a id="I116" spellcheck><h2>Virus not isolated</h2>
<p>The virus has still not been isolated as required by Koch's postulates. The prizes offered by critics for the provision of a virus isolate have not been redeemed by any virologist.</p></a>
<a id="I117" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated further contagious</h2>
<p>According to official data, vaccinated people continue to pass the virus on to others. This vaccination as a measure can therefore not be a way out of the official claimed crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I118" spellcheck><h2>The App in Moscow</h2>
<p>If you want to see the dystopian conditions we are already in, you only have to look at the Russian quarantine monitoring app - where machines are already monitoring people in captivity.</p></a>
<a id="I119" spellcheck><h2>Gibraltar after vaccination</h2>
<p>The figures in Gibraltar clearly show that a massive wave of disease only started when vaccination began. This is proof enough that vaccination does not serve its purpose.</p></a>
<a id="I120" spellcheck><h2>Upward redistribution</h2>
<p>Around the world, states and economies are forced to sell possessions, companies and shares via the lockdowns. This leads to a huge redistribution to big capital and hedge funds to convert their assets.</p></a>
<a id="I121" spellcheck><h2>45 cycles is a crime</h2>
<p>PCR test practice in many countries was and is to evaluate ct cycles of 35-45 still as positive. Since in this range no meaningful statements about an infection are possible anymore, this is a crime!</p></a>
<a id="I122" spellcheck><h2>Pharma: Healthy people?</h2>
<p>The confidence of many in the vaccine manufacturers is completely naive. Anyone who believes that the pharmaceutical industry wants healthy people also believes that the arms industry wants world peace.</p></a>
<a id="I123" spellcheck><h2>Symptoms not unique</h2>
<p>Covid disease has no clear symptoms at all that can be distinguished from countless other respiratory diseases. In many countries, everyone is simply added to the Covid statistic without testing.</p></a>
<a id="I124" spellcheck><h2>Vitamin C</h2>
<p>Vitamin C has been shown to reduce the tendency to oxidative stress, cytokine storm, and thrombosis in viral infection. Viral diseases should be treated with high-dose vitamin C therapy.</p></a>
<a id="I125" spellcheck><h2>Original virus nonexistant</h2>
<p>The original virus Sars-Cov-2 has already ceased to exist in the fall of 2020, only mutations. The current media representation has nothing to do with reality.</p></a>
<a id="I126" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns unprecedented</h2>
<p>The measure of economic lockdowns to contain a pandemic had never been used before Wuhan. There remains no robust evidence that it is effective, but countless that it causes untold suffering.</p></a>
<a id="I127" spellcheck><h2>Mutants billion-dollar business</h2>
<p>The virus mutants, which are now regularly discussed in the media, will in future provide pharmaceutical companies with permanent income in the billions through ever new vaccines and tests - without medical necessity!</p></a>
<a id="I128" spellcheck><h2>Dues will rise</h2>
<p>The crisis will not really get going until the state and insurance companies make up for their financial losses by raising taxes and contributions. This will again burden the middle class.</p></a>
<a id="I129" spellcheck><h2>Politicians above the law</h2>
<p>The many cases in which politicians and officials have themselves defied the rules they have imposed are a clear sign that they themselves do not believe in the dangerousness being propagated.</p></a>
<a id="I130" spellcheck><h2>Death certificates falsified</h2>
<p>Covid death statistics are massively inflated by manipulating death certificates in many countries. This manipulation is motivated by systemic pressures and incentives.</p></a>
<a id="I131" spellcheck><h2>Zanzibar / Tanzania</h2>
<p>The country of Tanzania, which has not taken any virus measures, shows that the crisis does not have a threatening medical dimension. The continuing tourism there is the best proof.</p></a>
<a id="I132" spellcheck><h2>Masks a Torture Tool</h2>
<p>The forced wearing of surgical masks is an instrument of torture. Such masks are used to terrorize all inmates at Guantanamo via reduced oxygen supply and sensory input.</p></a>
<a id="I133" spellcheck><h2>Home office makes lonely</h2>
<p>Forced distancing by working in a home office makes people lonely and triggers mental illness. Especially unstable and sensitive people are among the victims.</p></a>
<a id="I134" spellcheck><h2>New normal permanently</h2>
<p>The 'new normal' is not something temporary, but a permanently changed world. This is clear from the statements of those responsible.</p></a>
<a id="I135" spellcheck><h2>Cracking down on critics</h2>
<p>Around the world, the executive branch is rigorously cracking down on critical activists, doctors and lawyers. In the process, means in the legal gray area and also clearly unlawful means are used.</p></a>
<a id="I136" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination favors mutations</h2>
<p>Because the new vaccines do not achieve sterile immunity and vaccinated persons continue to be infectious virus carriers, the emergence of new virus mutations is unfortunately massively favored!</p></a>
<a id="I137" spellcheck><h2>Politicians just our employees</h2>
<p>Our politicians were elected by us to enforce the interests of us as citizens. If they don't do that, we have to fire them - that's how democracy works!</p></a>
<a id="I138" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination ID coming</h2>
<p>The digital, globally valid vaccination card is being created on the fly. Once it is there, it will be used to legitimize discrimination against people.</p></a>
<a id="I139" spellcheck><h2>Fourth estate missing</h2>
<p>In a society, the media are the fourth estate, with the role of providing critical support for the rulers. Currently, without serious criticism, they lack the corrective.</p></a>
<a id="I140" spellcheck><h2>Influencers harnessed</h2>
<p>Many celebrities and influencers are not randomly using their reach to spread the Corona narrative, but are part of a well-organized propaganda campaign!</p></a>
<a id="I141" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination increases mortality</h2>
<p>The mortality rates worldwide have been increasing since the beginning of the vaccination campaigns. It can no longer be covered up that the experimental vaccines are to blame for this!</p></a>
<a id="I142" spellcheck><h2>Israel Human Lab</h2>
<p>In Israel, since vaccination, the risk of death is hundreds of times higher compared to the disease, especially among young people. The country is a huge pharmaceutical human laboratory!</p></a>
<a id="I143" spellcheck><h2>There is no &lsquo;the science&rsquo;</h2>
<p>There is no such thing as 'the' science in the sense of 'the truth'. Science is based on hypothesis, experiment, validation or falsification. Everything else is scientism.</p></a>
<a id="I144" spellcheck><h2>What about Florida?</h2>
<p>In Florida, masks have never been mandatory, beaches have never been closed, and all children attend school normally. Nevertheless, fewer people have died from corona there than the U.S. average.</p></a>
<a id="I145" spellcheck><h2>What about North and South Dakota?</h2>
<p>North and South Dakota had the same pandemic development, although stringent measures were imposed in one part and none at all in the other. That is evidence enough that the measures are ineffective.</p></a>
<a id="I146" spellcheck><h2>What about Texas?</h2>
<p>After Texas lifted the lockdown and all Corona measures, it did not affect the already low casualty numbers. This shows the general futility of these regulatory interventions.</p></a>
<a id="I147" spellcheck><h2>Pollutants in masks/tests</h2>
<p>Toxic substances and harmful materials have been found in corona masks and also on the sticks of test kits. You only harm yourself when you use these things.</p></a>
<a id="I148" spellcheck><h2>Nuremberg Laws</h2>
<p>The partially acquired vaccination with experimental, little tested substances violates the Nuremberg Laws, because people are abused as guinea pigs here and are often not informed about this fact.</p></a>
<a id="I149" spellcheck><h2>Second Nuremberg Trials</h2>
<p>Lawyers worldwide are preparing trials comparable to the Nuremberg Trials. Both the Corona hoax and the vaccine experiments are crimes against humanity.</p></a>
<a id="I150" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine apartheid</h2>
<p>Granting vaccinated people more rights than unvaccinated people is clearly illegal discrimination. Excesses of this discrimination are already tantamount to apartheid in some countries.</p></a>
<a id="I151" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination card dystopian</h2>
<p>The digital vaccination passport, which is being established worldwide at full speed, leads directly to an authoritarian dystopia, as it can easily be developed into a social credit system on the Chinese model.</p></a>
<a id="I152" spellcheck><h2>Discourse deliberately poisoned</h2>
<p>The public and scientific discourse around the corona issue is deliberately sabotaged by media and influence agents. Critics are not only defamed, but also damaged and threatened in their existence.</p></a>
<a id="I153" spellcheck><h2>Not proportionate</h2>
<p>There is a principle that measures intended to achieve a legitimate purpose must be suitable, necessary and proportionate. This balancing exercise was never carried out for the current Corona measures.</p></a>
<a id="I154" spellcheck><h2>Positive is not infected</h2>
<p>PCR tests, nor any of the other tests currently in use, can detect viral infection. Therefore, referring to positives as 'newly infected' or their numbers as 'incidence' is misleading.</p></a>
<a id="I155" spellcheck><h2>Doctors have tunnel view</h2>
<p>Physicians are ill-suited as witnesses to the crisis, since they are confronted only with illness, suffering and death, and do not always overlook the reasons for their situation.</p></a>
<a id="I156" spellcheck><h2>Children not drivers</h2>
<p>Due to their typically strong immune system, children are able to cope well with respiratory viruses and do not fall ill very often. This is why they cannot be the drivers of a pandemic - and are unnecessarily overburdened with measures.</p></a>
<a id="I157" spellcheck><h2>Testing unnecessary</h2>
<p>It is completely unnecessary for a healthy person to undergo a Corona test. Anyone who undergoes a test to find out whether he is ill probably also goes regularly to the cemetery to find out whether he is already dead.</p></a>
<a id="I158" spellcheck><h2>Not exponential</h2>
<p>The spread of a viral disease does not proceed exponentially but in the form of a bell curve.  This is due to the decreasing number of potential hosts and their increasing immunity.</p></a>
<a id="I159" spellcheck><h2>Long Flu</h2>
<p>The proportion of long-term sequelae in covid disease is about 5%, which is as high as in influenza. This is not a peculiarity of this disease, as are the symptoms, such as loss of smell.</p></a>
<a id="I160" spellcheck><h2>Nothing learned</h2>
<p>The aim was to prevent a repetition of fascism in Europe through comprehensive school education. This was probably unsuccessful, because the majority falls for the old patterns again at the very first opportunity.</p></a>
<a id="I161" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates no mask</h2>
<p>Bill Gates has never been seen wearing a mask or doing anything else. This is a clear indication of who is really pulling the strings.</p></a>
<a id="I162" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is gene therapy</h2>
<p>Corona vaccination is a never before approved gene therapy intervention in humans. The name 'vaccination' was chosen only because it has a positive association.</p></a>
<a id="I163" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects not reported</h2>
<p>The adverse event rate is heavily skewed because most adverse events, especially deaths, are not recorded at all. Studies suggest that this reporting rate is in the single-digit percentage range.</p></a>
<a id="I164" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine shedding</h2>
<p>The spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination are toxic and can be excreted by the body of vaccinated persons. Thus, unvaccinated people in their vicinity are also harmed.</p></a>
<a id="I165" spellcheck><h2>Covid vascular disease</h2>
<p>Covid is actually a vascular disease in which the immune response to the spike proteins interferes with oxygen transport, e.g., in the lungs. The spike proteins permanently produced after vaccination even intensify this.</p></a>
<a id="I166" spellcheck><h2>Thrombosis due to spike proteins</h2>
<p>The spike proteins permanently produced by the vaccination lead to thrombosis by immune reaction. The long-term effect, which has not been investigated here, can lead to fatal consequences for the vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="I167" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating children crime</h2>
<p>With the attempt to enforce vaccination also in children, a red line has been crossed! Children have a much higher risk from vaccination than from the disease itself!</p></a>
<a id="I168" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating Placebo Luck</h2>
<p>The happiness and liberation that many feel after vaccination is only the falling away of their irrational fear. One can only hope that none of the lucky ones will suffer from severe side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I169" spellcheck><h2>Gurgling is enough</h2>
<p>Regular gargling with appropriate agents is perfectly sufficient to prevent the virus from entering one's own body. Measures and also vaccination would be superfluous if everyone did this.</p></a>
<a id="I170" spellcheck><h2>Deaths added up</h2>
<p>Covid victims are not recounted seasonally as in the case of influenza, but added up as individual waves of a large 'pandemic'. By dividing them up, we would be back to the dimensions of the flu.</p></a>
<a id="I171" spellcheck><h2>Mistreatment</h2>
<p>A large proportion of covid deaths would be preventable if they were treated early and properly. Well-studied and effective drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or ivermecin are suppressed.</p></a>
<a id="I172" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theories true</h2>
<p>Many of the critics' predictions, such as the introduction of a digital vaccination card or even compulsory vaccination, which were initially dismissed as nonsense, have since come true - barely noticed.</p></a>
<a id="I173" spellcheck><h2>New way of counting</h2>
<p>Regulatory and statistical sleight of hand are used worldwide to try to present the vaccination campaign as a success. This should actually see through everyone with school mathematics knowledge.</p></a>
<a id="I174" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination site magnetic</h2>
<p>Many vaccinated people have noticed that their upper arm is magnetic at the injection site. This effect cannot be explained by the official ingredients of the vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="I175" spellcheck><h2>Like &lsquo;The Wave&rsquo;</h2>
<p>The behavior of the majority of people in crisis is similar to that of the students in the well-known film 'The Wave'. The insights gained in the film can be directly transferred to our current reality.</p></a>
<a id="I176" spellcheck><h2>No sterile immunity</h2>
<p>None of the vaccines approved against the virus have achieved sterile immunity. And that therefore the links of 'relaxations' with the vaccination rate is completely meaningless.</p></a>
<a id="I177" spellcheck><h2>AIDS segments in the virus</h2>
<p>The genome of the virus contains distinctive segments of the AIDS virus. This is so unlikely that it is a strong indication that the virus was created by the so-called gene scissors in the laboratory.</p></a>
<a id="I178" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine damage-dark figure high</h2>
<p>In the case of vaccinations, only 1-10% of side effects and deaths are reported. Also in the case of this virus, there is a large number of unreported cases and a large part of the damage remains undocumented.</p></a>
<a id="I179" spellcheck><h2>Trans-Humanism Agenda</h2>
<p>One of the big agendas behind the crisis is that of transhumanism, which stands for a fusion of man and machine. Its elitist advocates envision the immortality of their own souls.</p></a>
<a id="I180" spellcheck><h2>The virus is a hoax</h2>
<p>The excitement about the virus and its supposed dangerousness is a single hoax, which serves the worldwide implementation of other big plans. This will also soon become apparent.</p></a>
<a id="I181" spellcheck><h2>Will endure the virus</h2>
<p>My personal immune system is strong enough to survive an illness with the virus. Therefore, I neither take the measures seriously nor do I need or trust the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I182" spellcheck><h2>Only Emergency Admissions</h2>
<p>All vaccines have only a limited emergency approval, which never justifies the mindless vaccination of a large part of the world's population. The approval would be immediately null and void if the pandemic were declared over.</p></a>
<a id="I183" spellcheck><h2>Won't stop at 1x</h2>
<p>Who thinks, with a vaccination round one would be out of the responsibility, has miscalculated. It is already foreseeable that the own vaccination with all risks must be renewed at least every year.</p></a>
<a id="I184" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Gain of Function&rsquo; research</h2>
<p>For decades, government money has been used to research viruses as bio-weapons. The current virus can possibly also be traced back to this 'gain-of-function' research, which most recently took place in Wuhan.</p></a>
<a id="I185" spellcheck><h2>Triage in child psychiatry</h2>
<p>While successfully preventing triage for respiratory problems caused by the virus, at the same time the bottleneck has long been there: for children's mental health problems.</p></a>
<a id="I186" spellcheck><h2>Eugenics link</h2>
<p>Besides Bill Gates, other actors, e.g. the Moderna developers, have links to the eugenics movement. It is possible that the forced mass vaccination is also about population reduction.</p></a>
<a id="I187" spellcheck><h2>Ivermecin</h2>
<p>The antimalarial drug ivermecin has been successfully used to treat Corona. Nevertheless, it is suppressed worldwide and is thus not available to physicians for treatment.</p></a>
<a id="I188" spellcheck><h2>Hydroxychloroquine</h2>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine is a simple, over-the-counter treatment for respiratory diseases. Its widespread use was successfully prevented by a manipulated study.</p></a>
<a id="I189" spellcheck><h2>Absolute risk reduction</h2>
<p>The absolute risk reduction for all approved vaccines is only in the range of 1%, so it has no effect on society as a whole. With numbers, presented in the appropriate way, you can prove everything.</p></a>
<a id="I190" spellcheck><h2>Neofeudalism</h2>
<p>The concentration of wealth among fewer and fewer people has accelerated further with the crisis. The unequal power relations have long been tantamount to a new feudalism.</p></a>
<a id="I191" spellcheck><h2>You'll own nothing</h2>
<p>Among the visions formulated at the WEF for the time after the Great Reset is the happy renunciation of possessions. The 1% of the super-rich are excluded from this, of course.</p></a>
<a id="I192" spellcheck><h2>Klaus Schwab</h2>
<p>Shortly after the beginning of the crisis, WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab already explained in a book how the unique 'Window of Opportunity' must be used: implement the necessary changes in the world now.</p></a>
<a id="I193" spellcheck><h2>Young Global Leaders</h2>
<p>The WEF trains top politicians in its Young Global Leaders program to advance its interests. All government politicians from this cadre readily support the Corona narrative!</p></a>
<a id="I194" spellcheck><h2>Stakeholder Capitalism</h2>
<p>The WEF's Great Reset envisions nothing less than the transformation of the global economy into a 'stakeholder' capitalism determined by large corporations to ensure greater responsibility for resources and the environment.</p></a>
<a id="I195" spellcheck><h2>Next: climate change</h2>
<p>The Great Reset is also intended to solve the responsibility problem of climate change by concentrating economic power among a few stakeholders. We must soon also expect repressive restrictions on freedom in favor of the climate.</p></a>
<a id="I196" spellcheck><h2>Protests hushed</h2>
<p>Most people are unaware of the massive opposition to the Corona Agenda, as ongoing protests by several hundred thousand people worldwide are simply downplayed, defamed, or completely hushed up by the media.</p></a>
<a id="I197" spellcheck><h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>The corona virus is also a virus that is only seasonally active; the much-cited 'waves' can be explained as seasonal waves. It is therefore wrong to add up the victims of these waves.</p></a>
<a id="I198" spellcheck><h2>Bio-weapons deployments?</h2>
<p>It is possible that some outbreaks in the crisis were caused by using the virus as a bio-weapon. If so, the conspirators have all the means in hand to maintain the state of emergency until their plans are implemented.</p></a>
<a id="I199" spellcheck><h2>mRNA nanoparticles</h2>
<p>mRNA vaccines are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, which are typically not intended for human use. This allows them to reach all organs, including bone marrow, thyroid and reproductive organs!</p></a>
<a id="I200" spellcheck><h2>Insolvencies</h2>
<p>Countless companies have been driven into insolvency by lockdowns. They threaten the existence of many more people than the virus ever could. In some countries, the effects are only delayed by changes in the law.</p></a>
<a id="I201" spellcheck><h2>Agenda Unstoppable</h2>
<p>Those who are pursuing their own hidden agenda with the fake virus crisis have no other option but to push it further. They are threatened with exposure and persecution if the people find out.</p></a>
<a id="I202" spellcheck><h2>US states without action</h2>
<p>The majority of Republican U.S. states managed without measures. The fact that no negative effects were observed there should raise critical questions in the rest of the world about their own policy on measures.</p></a>
<a id="I203" spellcheck><h2>Masks and occupational safety</h2>
<p>Professional dust masks prescribed in many countries may only be used for short periods and with breaks according to applicable occupational health and safety regulations. This plays practically no role in public communication.</p></a>
<a id="I204" spellcheck><h2>20 years of adverse effects</h2>
<p>Far fewer adverse events have been reported for all vaccines worldwide in the last 20 years combined than for the Corona vaccines in a few months. All testing mechanisms have failed here.</p></a>
<a id="I205" spellcheck><h2>Intellectuals silent</h2>
<p>The majority of artists and intellectuals have not understood the threat to their and our future posed by the staged crisis. They have remained silent for fear of the virus or social ostracism.</p></a>
<a id="I206" spellcheck><h2>Social Credit System Coming</h2>
<p>Politicians around the world are looking to the Chinese model to keep the population in check. Solutions like the digital vaccination passport go exactly in the direction of the Chinese social credit system.</p></a>
<a id="I207" spellcheck><h2>Job pressure to vaccinate</h2>
<p>While there is no mandatory vaccination, people in certain professions around the world are practically faced with the choice of getting vaccinated or losing their jobs. For many who have learned nothing else, vaccinating is the only way.</p></a>
<a id="I208" spellcheck><h2>Full Admission Threatens</h2>
<p>The transition from emergency to full approval of Corona vaccines is the real danger, as manufacturers will no longer be subject to any obligations and can even change ingredients after the fact.</p></a>
<a id="I209" spellcheck><h2>Corona is a cult</h2>
<p>Corona is a cult whose disciples identify themselves by meticulously wearing masks. The inoculation is tantamount to an initiation ritual, and the permanent media pressure serves to consolidate the doctrine of salvation.</p></a>
<a id="I210" spellcheck><h2>Social Media Bots</h2>
<p>Interest groups assert their interests by cleverly influencing social media using bots. That's why you always have to be very careful with sentiment images you receive on these channels.</p></a>
<a id="I211" spellcheck><h2>China Blueprint</h2>
<p>China's repressive social model, with full surveillance and a social credit system, is seen by politicians in the rest of the world as a blueprint for restructuring their own societies. One must be on one's guard here!</p></a>
<a id="I212" spellcheck><h2>Social Distancing weakens</h2>
<p>Without infections, our immune system is not trained. Therefore, social distancing is very harmful, especially for children. Because a weak immune system may not be able to cope with harmless germs in the future.</p></a>
<a id="I213" spellcheck><h2>Staying inside unhealthy</h2>
<p>People lonely retreat in their homes. They suffer not only psychologically, but also physically and in their immune defenses due to poor eating habits, lack of exercise and sunlight.</p></a>
<a id="I214" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated should not fly</h2>
<p>Some airlines advise vaccinated people not to fly or even exclude them from flights because of thrombosis risks. Those who have been vaccinated for the freedom to travel may soon find the opposite is true!</p></a>
<a id="I215" spellcheck><h2>Like a PsyOp</h2>
<p>The prescribed corona measures clearly have elements of psychological warfare. Masks, for example, let wearers experience the dreaded disease via their own shortness of breath, social distancing others as a potential risk and no longer as fellow human beings.</p></a>
<a id="I216" spellcheck><h2>mRNA unsuccessful for years</h2>
<p>Research on mRNA vaccines has been ongoing for many years without success. The safety concerns due to which these vaccines were never approved still exist and have only been circumvented by pressure and emergency approvals.</p></a>
<a id="I217" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated Unwanted</h2>
<p>A general defensive attitude towards the unvaccinated leads to arbitrary exclusion rules in more and more areas of life. This is deliberate, in order to act as an indirect vaccination coercion.</p></a>
<a id="I218" spellcheck><h2>Vaginal bleeding</h2>
<p>Many cases of changes in female menstruation after vaccinations are an alarm signal that the reproductive system may be affected. Normally, this should have led to a stop of the vaccinations long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I219" spellcheck><h2>Heart muscle inflammation</h2>
<p>Many cases of myocarditis after vaccinations, especially in young people, are an alarm signal for life-threatening late effects. Normally, this should have led to a stop of the vaccinations long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I220" spellcheck><h2>Phase 3 trials</h2>
<p>All vaccines are still in phase 3 of their testing, so all vaccinated people are unpaid study participants. Most of them have never been informed about this fact.</p></a>
<a id="I221" spellcheck><h2>I am the control group</h2>
<p>Even without being vaccinated, I am a study participant in the global vaccination experiment, only in the control group. I can only warmly recommend this form of participation.</p></a>
<a id="I222" spellcheck><h2>Adverse events difficult to report</h2>
<p>The official registration of vaccination adverse events is hampered by complicated procedures and high hurdles. Therefore, only a very small proportion of problems are actually reported.</p></a>
<a id="I223" spellcheck><h2>Victims &lsquo;post-harvest&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Seasonal respiratory diseases sometimes kill more or less people during the cold season. If fewer died in the previous season, the survivors may be caught in the next season as a so-called 'post-harvest'.</p></a>
<a id="I224" spellcheck><h2>Enough vaccinated</h2>
<p>Herd immunity only requires 60-70% of people to be immune. Therefore, I do not need to vaccinate myself but simply wait until enough others are immune or vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="I225" spellcheck><h2>Concentrated patients</h2>
<p>Overload situations in hospitals were not the rule but the exception during the crisis. These exceptions were partly staged for the media by concentrating patients.</p></a>
<a id="I226" spellcheck><h2>Death from loneliness</h2>
<p>Many victims have been in nursing homes and homes for the elderly because they have been deprived of contact with relatives and their dignity and love of life. These have died as a result of food refusal, dehydration and loneliness.</p></a>
<a id="I227" spellcheck><h2>Studies concealed</h2>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has concealed many studies and results in connection with its research that would show how dangerous certain technologies are. We have been tricked here for decades already.</p></a>
<a id="I228" spellcheck><h2>Gates and Epstein close</h2>
<p>Bill Gates' former close contacts with pedophile Lolita Island owner Jeffrey Epstein cost him his marriage. People who move in these criminal circles cannot be trusted.</p></a>
<a id="I229" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination dependence</h2>
<p>Because after vaccination the immune system can no longer cope with the pathogen on its own, a lifelong dependence on follow-up vaccinations arises for vaccinated persons. Thus, no end to the new normal is to be expected.</p></a>
<a id="I230" spellcheck><h2>DNA databases</h2>
<p>With the many tests, it would be possible to create huge DNA databases. Totalitarian horror scenarios like those from Hollywood would suddenly become more real than we can imagine.</p></a>
<a id="I231" spellcheck><h2>Shock Doctrine</h2>
<p>The deception of the public so aptly described by Naomi Klein is currently taking place worldwide in exemplary fashion. Only the majority - including Ms. Klein herself - has not yet understood this.</p></a>
<a id="I232" spellcheck><h2>Not vaccinate in pandemic</h2>
<p>A long-known epidemiological principle is not to vaccinate into an epidemic or pandemic. Because this principle is being ignored right now, we are far from overcoming it and far worse consequences are looming.</p></a>
<a id="I233" spellcheck><h2>McCarthy like attacks</h2>
<p>In many cases, attacks against critics take place that are strongly reminiscent of the McCarthy era. Defamation, media incitement, occupational bans, dismissals and account terminations are already the rule, unnoticed by the public.</p></a>
<a id="I234" spellcheck><h2>Doctors don't want to get vaccinated</h2>
<p>According to surveys, the majority of doctors and hospital staff had no intention of getting vaccinated - but did so anyway under pressure. They should know best why they think that way.</p></a>
<a id="I235" spellcheck><h2>High hourly wage in vaccination centres</h2>
<p>The very high hourly wages for physicians in vaccination centers act as a reward and a hush money - and help to act against one's oath. Physicians have always been susceptible to this kind of outside influence.</p></a>
<a id="I236" spellcheck><h2>Cancer amplified by vaccination</h2>
<p>Vaccination promotes the development of cancers such as leukemia and causes cancers that have been overcome to return in many patients. These signals should normally have led to a stop to vaccination long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I237" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems due to vaccination</h2>
<p>Heart attacks, blood pressure problems and cardiac arrhythmias have statistically increased sharply since vaccination. These signals should normally have led to a stop of the vaccinations long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I238" spellcheck><h2>Insufficient education before vaccination</h2>
<p>Vaccinated persons are often not properly informed about the experimental nature of the vaccination, ongoing studies and already known risks, although this is mandatory. The vaccinating physicians are liable for this.</p></a>
<a id="I239" spellcheck><h2>Side effect victims not covered</h2>
<p>Victims of vaccine injuries are not adequately covered, let alone compensated, in part because manufacturers use extensive clauses to get out of liability.</p></a>
<a id="I240" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Outsourcing&rsquo; of discrimination</h2>
<p>In the blanket social exclusion of the unvaccinated, the state 'outsources' to the private sector discriminatory coercive measures that it cannot itself impose.</p></a>
<a id="I241" spellcheck><h2>Continued excess mortality since vaccination started</h2>
<p>Since the start of the vaccination campaign, there has been a statistically significant, steadily increasing excess mortality that cannot be explained by corona victims. Unrecognized vaccination side effects may be a plausible cause.</p></a>
<a id="I242" spellcheck><h2>Natural immunity durable</h2>
<p>Natural immunity acquired through viral infection provides lasting protection against disease and infection. The time-limited recognition of a recovery is not only unscientific but also harmful with vaccination pressure.</p></a>
<a id="I243" spellcheck><h2>Plane crashes since vaccination</h2>
<p>An increasing number of aviation emergencies have occurred since vaccination began. From pilots dying in flight to airplane crashes, much points to sudden vaccination deaths.</p></a>
<a id="I244" spellcheck><h2>Increasing accidents since vaccination</h2>
<p>In everyday life, an increasing number of accidents such as falls due to weakness or dizziness to car accidents have been observed since the start of vaccination. Much points to after-effects of the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I245" spellcheck><h2>Dressed like monkeys by rules</h2>
<p>Many prescribed measures become increasingly senseless over time, but are now implemented uncritically by a majority of people. This gives the impression of 'trained monkeys'.</p></a>
<a id="I246" spellcheck><h2>&lsquo;Passed away suddenly and unexpectedly&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of vaccinations, reports of 'sudden and unexpected' deaths, especially of celebrities, have been accumulating. There are many indications that these are vaccination victims.</p></a>
<a id="I247" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of the vaccinated</h2>
<p>The claimed 'pandemic of the unvaccinated' in reality becomes one of the vaccinated, as they become perspective victims due to their weakened immune systems and the side effects of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I248" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine makes Corona</h2>
<p>Vaccination induces corona-like symptoms in vaccinated individuals via the spike proteins produced, which correspond to the virus and are indistinguishable from the viral disease. Thus, vaccination prolongs the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I249" spellcheck><h2>Mass vaccination does nothing</h2>
<p>Mass vaccination does not seem to work because statistically there is no correlation between vaccination rates and corona waves or outbreaks worldwide. Vaccination is an ineffective medical measure at best.</p></a>
<a id="I250" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination lasts only shortly</h2>
<p>The vaccination effect, especially against common variants of the virus, statistically lasts only a few months. Therefore, the security that vaccinated people may feel is a deceptive one.</p></a>
<a id="I251" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination weakens immune system</h2>
<p>Vaccination weakens the immune system by 'reprogramming' it to specialize in fighting a single pathogen. Vaccinated people are subsequently more susceptible to all other pathogens.</p></a>
<a id="I252" spellcheck><h2>PCR test unsuitable for diagnoses</h2>
<p>The inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mulis, described it as unsuitable for diagnostic purposes because it could be used to detect 'anything you want'. However, the whole narrative was initially based only on these 'diagnoses'.</p></a>
<a id="I253" spellcheck><h2>Conflicts of interest among decision-makers</h2>
<p>Decision-makers worldwide on the Corona issue in politics, institutions and the media have conflicts of interest due to which they do not make independent decisions. This is one of the reasons for this undesirable development.</p></a>
<a id="I254" spellcheck><h2>After the jab its too late</h2>
<p>Vaccinations have been implemented with such speed and vigor that by the time one learns of the dire side effects in one's own environment, it is already too late for the individual. Wait and see is the better strategy.</p></a>
<a id="I255" spellcheck><h2>Shame of side effects of vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>Many vaccinated persons may already suspect the vaccination for their side effects, but do not communicate this out of shame. In this way, the important real picture from their own environment is distorted.</p></a>
<a id="I256" spellcheck><h2>Adverse event susceptibility of vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>Many vaccinated people blame everything but the vaccination for their side effects. In this way, the important real picture of the side effects from their own environment is distorted.</p></a>
<a id="I257" spellcheck><h2>Physicians' adverse event ignorance</h2>
<p>Many physicians and also medical personnel blame everything but the vaccination for obvious vaccination side effects of their patients. In this way, they subconsciously insulate their worldview from doubt.</p></a>
<a id="I258" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated in ICUs</h2>
<p>Since vaccination, a steadily increasing number of vaccinated people end up in hospitals and intensive care units. These numbers are misrepresented and hidden from the public with various pretexts.</p></a>
<a id="I259" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated among Corona victims</h2>
<p>Since the vaccination, a steadily increasing number of vaccinated people have been among the Corona victims. These figures are downplayed and hidden from the public, for example on the grounds that they do not want to jeopardize the vaccination campaign.</p></a>
<a id="I260" spellcheck><h2> &lsquo;unvaccinated&rsquo; after vaccination</h2>
<p>People between their vaccinations and in the critical period 14 days after the second vaccination are still considered unvaccinated. If they fall ill or die during this period, they are included in the statistics as corona victims and not as vaccination victims.</p></a>
<a id="I261" spellcheck><h2>Marburg is next</h2>
<p>Due to the public communication of various institutions and the ongoing vaccine research, the next virus can already be expected. This is very likely to be the Marburg virus.</p></a>
<a id="I262" spellcheck><h2>Corman-Drosten Report</h2>
<p>The Corman-Drosten report shows that the crucial PCR test paper was reviewed in an unrealistically short time and a later review highlighted massive flaws. This must now be classified as scientific misconduct.</p></a>
<a id="I263" spellcheck><h2>Studies must be limited</h2>
<p>Studies on the safety and efficacy of vaccines must be carried out on a limited number of participants in accordance with regulations. However, they are currently being conducted unlawfully on the entire world population.</p></a>
<a id="I264" spellcheck><h2>Also for risk behaviour</h2>
<p>Sanctions required against the unvaccinated (such as higher health premiums, triage) due to assumed additional risks to the health care system would, in fairness, also have to be imposed on any other risky behavior.</p></a>
<a id="I265" spellcheck><h2>Also for unhealthy lifestyle</h2>
<p>Penalties required against the unvaccinated due to assumed additional risks to the health care system would have to be fairly imposed for unhealthy lifestyles/nutrition as well, since they weaken the immune system.</p></a>
<a id="I266" spellcheck><h2>Everyone ends up immunized</h2>
<p>There are simply two routes to covid immunization: vaccination or infection. In the next few years, everyone is likely to receive some form of immunization without the need for appropriate action.</p></a>
<a id="I267" spellcheck><h2>Waiting for dead vaccine</h2>
<p>All current vaccines are based on experimental methods that have never been used on humans before - such as mRNA technology. I lack confidence here and therefore prefer to wait for classical inactivated vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="I268" spellcheck><h2>Waiting for proper approval</h2>
<p>All current vaccinations do not yet have a regular but only an emergency approval. Therefore, I prefer to wait for a proper approval, which comes with a completed safety inspection.</p></a>
<a id="I269" spellcheck><h2>Wait for effective vaccination</h2>
<p>Data show that the current vaccine products have only a weak and not lasting effect. Therefore, I prefer to wait for vaccines for which a more durable efficacy has been determined.</p></a>
<a id="I270" spellcheck><h2>Don't need a vaccination subscription</h2>
<p>Vaccination is designed as a 'subscription' that requires ongoing treatment to maintain its benefits. I have had bad experiences with subscriptions in other contexts and therefore prefer to do without.</p></a>
<a id="I271" spellcheck><h2>Without vaccination already no triage</h2>
<p>Initially, when the vaccination rate was zero, there was no hospital overload or even a need for triage. Currently, with the high vaccination rate, this is even less to be expected if the vaccination has its promised effect.</p></a>
<a id="I272" spellcheck><h2>Ivermectin successful in India</h2>
<p>Campbell, Ōmura and Tu received the Nobel Prize in 2015 for ivermectin, which has also been shown to be effective against covid in the field. In certain parts of India, it has already led to permanent containment of the disease.</p></a>
<a id="I273" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination worse than disease</h2>
<p>Vaccinations have already produced such an unmanageable range of side effect diagnoses from blindness to thrombosis that one can literally state that the therapy is worse than the disease itself.</p></a>
<a id="I274" spellcheck><h2>Restrictions due to politics</h2>
<p>Continued societal restrictions exist not because of the unvaccinated, but because of politicians who fail to keep their promises and simply continue to patronize citizens for no comprehensible reason.</p></a>
<a id="I275" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not for health reasons</h2>
<p>According to surveys, few people got vaccinated out of health concerns. As a rule, regaining freedoms, freedom from time-consuming procedures and external pressure were cited as decisive reasons.</p></a>
<a id="I276" spellcheck><h2>All would have to test themselves</h2>
<p>Exempting vaccinated people from testing, even though they are similarly contagious in case of illness, is a counterproductive measure. A sensible testing strategy can only be the continued testing of all.</p></a>
<a id="I277" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is a risk</h2>
<p>With every vaccination, but especially with the current experimental Corona vaccination, one runs the risk of harming oneself. Because of the right to self-determination, no one may be pressured to undergo this intervention.</p></a>
<a id="I278" spellcheck><h2>What about Waterford?</h2>
<p>The Irish town of Waterford has both an almost 100% vaccination rate and the highest covid rate in the country. This is a clear indication of the ineffectiveness or even harmfulness of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I279" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not permanent</h2>
<p>The vaccination is not permanently effective, but requires "boosters" at regular intervals. This was already foreseen in the plans of both manufacturers and governments worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I280" spellcheck><h2>Safe through memory cells</h2>
<p>The fixation on antibody determination as evidence of immunity assumes an incorrect model of the human immune system. Already appropriate memory cells provide effective immunity.</p></a>
<a id="I281" spellcheck><h2>Differences in vaccine doses</h2>
<p>There is a suspicion that the manufacturers have partly circulated variants of their vaccine or even placebos. This at least explains the large differences in efficacy and side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I282" spellcheck><h2>Corona continuous loop</h2>
<p>The official Corona 'truth' is put into people's heads through the technique of repetition. While the narrative runs in a continuous loop, critical voices are transported only sporadically as a 'fig leaf'.</p></a>
<a id="I283" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not protect against severe course</h2>
<p>The promised protection of vaccination against severe covid has long been shown to be a false promise. Vaccination must therefore now be seen more as a risk than a preventive measure.</p></a>
<a id="I284" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not bring herd immunity</h2>
<p>A vaccination that prevents neither infection nor transmission of the virus cannot logically bring herd immunity. Therefore, all arguments in this direction are invalid.</p></a>
<a id="I285" spellcheck><h2>Embarrassing politician masquerade</h2>
<p>Politicians and media representatives worldwide have been convicted of deliberately masquerading for media images. It is a no-go that these people impose regulations on the masses that they themselves do not abide by.</p></a>
<a id="I286" spellcheck><h2>Range of side effects obscured</h2>
<p>The wide range of different side effects of vaccinations, for example in the area of vascular and nervous diseases, obscure the connection. Their proper investigation is long overdue.</p></a>
<a id="I287" spellcheck><h2>Prior knowledge of the pandemic obvious</h2>
<p>There is a great deal of evidence of prior knowledge of the pandemic, for example among vaccine manufacturers and officials involved. This raises suspicions of large-scale fraud and should have led to a criminal investigation long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I288" spellcheck><h2>Consider individual factors</h2>
<p>Whether the virus or the vaccine is more dangerous is very individual. Young people who now have thromboses or heart problems due to the vaccination would not have had a problem with the virus. Vaccination must therefore be a personal decision.</p></a>
<a id="I289" spellcheck><h2>Other definitions amended</h2>
<p>In addition to the WHO definition of a pandemic, which was amended in 2009, other terms have since been officially redefined to fit, including herd immunity and vaccine. This clearly indicates influence by interest groups.</p></a>
<a id="I290" spellcheck><h2>Industry interests are exposed</h2>
<p>The interests of the pharmaceutical and digital industries, for example, in selling specific products and solutions in the wake of the crisis are completely exposed. For this reason alone, no end to the crisis can be expected.</p></a>
<a id="I291" spellcheck><h2>Investor interests are open</h2>
<p>The interests of investors and financial groups such as Blackrock and Vanguard in profiting to the maximum from the crisis are completely exposed. For this reason alone, no end to the crisis can be expected.</p></a>
<a id="I292" spellcheck><h2>Discrimination unscientific</h2>
<p>Regulations introduced worldwide to exclude the unvaccinated from society have no scientific basis and only serve to increase vaccination pressure. Moreover, they cannot be reconciled with the protection against discrimination.</p></a>
<a id="I293" spellcheck><h2>Fraud in registration studies</h2>
<p>The manufacturers have long since been proven to have committed multiple frauds within the approval procedures and studies for their novel vaccines. With this knowledge, the vaccines should have been withdrawn from the market long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I294" spellcheck><h2>Forced vaccination of tourists</h2>
<p>In the meantime, not even travelers in other countries are spared from compulsory vaccination, as Indonesia has now introduced compulsory vaccination for tourists. Unvaccinated people should be very careful when planning their trip.</p></a>
<a id="I295" spellcheck><h2>Predictive Programming</h2>
<p>We were already prepared for the crisis by predictive programming before it happened: Utopia, Vexille, V for Vendetta, Equilibrium, Demolition Man, Idiocracy, They Live, etc. This has long been a proven means of social engineering.</p></a>
<a id="I296" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccines never approved</h2>
<p>mRNA vaccines that received emergency approval during the crisis have never received approval before in their 20 years of development. Trials were usually stopped during preclinical due to animals dying.</p></a>
<a id="I297" spellcheck><h2>Even zoo animals die from vaccination</h2>
<p>In the meantime, not only zoo animals have received vaccination, but side effect victims have already been reported. This is another indication of the experimental nature of these preparations.</p></a>
<a id="I298" spellcheck><h2>Blackened EU Treaties</h2>
<p>Hardly any representative of the people within the EU has access to the unredacted contents of the contracts agreed with vaccine manufacturers. This indicates completely undemocratic processes and procedures by those responsible.</p></a>
<a id="I299" spellcheck><h2>Subscription-Fall</h2>
<p>Many vaccinated people were lured into a kind of subscription trap and deceived about the fact that vaccination is a permanent therapy. Therefore, prominent supporters have now also come to a more critical stance - Jordan Peterson, for example.</p></a>
<a id="I300" spellcheck><h2>Know vaccination damage in the immediate environment</h2>
<p>Even small random samples in one's own circle of acquaintances already produce severe vaccine damage. Therefore, the side effect rate must be significantly higher than officially stated.</p></a>
<a id="I301" spellcheck><h2>Corona in the USA was Remdesivir</h2>
<p>Extensive use of remdesevir according to the CDC's official recommendation was responsible for a significant proportion of corona deaths in the United States. The recommendation was even justified by a study that found the drug to have a high death rate.</p></a>
<a id="I302" spellcheck><h2>Corona in GB was Midazolam</h2>
<p>Extensive use of the palliative drug midazolam as officially recommended by the NHS was responsible for a significant proportion of corona deaths in the UK. The dosage was life-threatening.</p></a>
<a id="I303" spellcheck><h2>Rockefeller Foundation involved</h2>
<p>In addition to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation also had a decisive influence on the genesis of the artificial Corona crisis. The interest here lies, among other things, in forcing a worldwide infrastructure for compulsory vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="I304" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems already in newborns</h2>
<p>Increasingly, newborns whose mothers have been vaccinated are already being born with heart problems. These indications of the transition of undesirable side effects also via the reproductive system must be taken seriously.</p></a>
<a id="I305" spellcheck><h2>It's just ... salami tactics</h2>
<p>It's just a mask. Only two weeks. Just the non-systemic ones. Just to flatten the curve. Just to take the pressure off the hospitals. Just an app. Just a few more months. Just one vaccine. Just a vaccination certificate. Just to travel. Just a few more years...</p></a>
<a id="I306" spellcheck><h2>Spanish flu was vaccine related</h2>
<p>The millions of victims of the Spanish flu, mentioned again and again as a reference, were in reality not victims of a virus but of experimental treatments. One of these treatments was already a so-called vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I307" spellcheck><h2>Recovered only second-class immunity</h2>
<p>The convalescent status, contrary to scientific reality, is only a second-class immunity, although it has been proven to be an ongoing protection. This alone shows that political and not medical decisions are being made here.</p></a>
<a id="I308" spellcheck><h2>For now everything is Long Covid</h2>
<p>Many people tend to attribute current health complaints to a previous corona infection. Studies of Long Covid have no comparison group and symptoms are simply associated with a previous infection.</p></a>
<a id="I309" spellcheck><h2>Only works on Alpha and Beta</h2>
<p>According to the manufacturer Pfizer, their vaccine is only effective against the alpha and beta variants of the virus; no statement can be made for all others because no data are available.</p></a>
<a id="I310" spellcheck><h2>Delta only vaccination adverse events</h2>
<p>Effects of the so-called delta variant, which in reality is less dangerous, are only effects of mass vaccination. Further vaccination and side effects keep the pandemic going.</p></a>
<a id="I311" spellcheck><h2>Regulatory studies manipulated</h2>
<p>Corona approval studies by manufacturers have been heavily manipulated, such as removing vaccine-injured individuals from the data. The FDA has received a lot of evidence on this and ignored it all.</p></a>
<a id="I312" spellcheck><h2>Why not all admitted?</h2>
<p>If vaccination is the solution to the pandemic, why are major vaccine manufacturers being shut out of supply in many parts of the world? That alone makes it clear that this is not about urgent management of a med. crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I313" spellcheck><h2>Pressure on patients unethical</h2>
<p>Pressure on patients is not compatible with medical ethics. Therefore, in accordance with their own self-image, physicians should actually distance themselves clearly from the political vaccination campaign and its implementation.</p></a>
<a id="I314" spellcheck><h2>Not what Bill Gates wants</h2>
<p>A successful strategy for getting through the crisis without damage is clearly not to do everything that Bill Gates demands and recommends. In this way, many have already come a long way through the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="I315" spellcheck><h2>Why protein blueprint?</h2>
<p>Why inoculate a blueprint for a protein when you could also administer this protein directly? With direct administration, it could even be dosed better and individually.</p></a>
<a id="I316" spellcheck><h2>No correlation between vaccination rate and number of cases</h2>
<p>No correlation could be found between the course of the vaccination campaigns or the vaccination rate and the development of corona disease. Thus, the vaccination campaign cannot be a way out of the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I317" spellcheck><h2>sacking of nurses</h2>
<p>All over the world, unvaccinated nurses and assistants are being dismissed from their jobs in the medical care of the population on a large scale. Given the already tense situation, this is completely counterproductive.</p></a>
<a id="I318" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims are a taboo subject</h2>
<p>Vaccination victims, who exist in large numbers worldwide, are ignored and made taboo in the mass media. This manipulation is justified, among other things, by not wanting to undermine or endanger the vaccination campaign.</p></a>
<a id="I319" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims not caught up</h2>
<p>There is no provision for catching vaccination victims, as is the case with other vaccinations. Instead, the victims themselves would sign on to take responsibility for possible side effects, and the state and the manufacturer would be released from liability.</p></a>
<a id="I320" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims not taken seriously</h2>
<p>Vaccination victims worldwide have great difficulty in having the damage they have suffered taken seriously and associated with vaccination. Damage is typically explained as coincidence by the majority of medical professionals, also in order to remove themselves from responsibility.</p></a>
<a id="I321" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality increasing with vaccination rate</h2>
<p>With higher vaccination rate of a country statistically also the excess mortality increases, without that these excess victims could be explained as corona deaths. The only explanation lies in vaccination, which cannot be officially admitted.</p></a>
<a id="I322" spellcheck><h2>Gibraltar 100% vaccination rate</h2>
<p>Gibraltar has already vaccinated virtually all of its residents, and yet high incidence rates justify further drastic non-pharmaceutical measures. This vaccination pioneer shows that vaccination will not be a way out of the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I323" spellcheck><h2>Hydroxychloroquin sabotaged</h2>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine production facilities in Taiwan have mysteriously exploded and burned down. This must be seen as another act of suppression of drug covid therapies.</p></a>
<a id="I324" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine breakthroughs in severely ill patients</h2>
<p>It is often stated that vaccine breakthroughs occur mainly among the severely ill, while at the same time it is precisely those who should be protected with vaccination as a matter of priority. This contradiction shows that vaccination does not provide a solution to the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I325" spellcheck><h2>Symptomatic vaccinated statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Statistical data in everyday medical practice on the burden of unvaccinated persons are manipulated in such a way that vaccinated persons who have contracted the virus are simply counted as unvaccinated persons. Thus, the proportion of the unvaccinated is overrepresented.</p></a>
<a id="I326" spellcheck><h2>Unknown vaccination status statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Statistical data in everyday medical practice on the burden of the unvaccinated are manipulated so that vaccination status is not recorded and an unknown vaccination status is counted as unvaccinated. Thus, the proportion of unvaccinated is overrepresented.</p></a>
<a id="I327" spellcheck><h2>Burden due to unvaccinated proportion cumulative</h2>
<p>Statistical data in everyday medical practice on the burden of the unvaccinated are manipulated in such a way that the ratio of the unvaccinated to the vaccinated has been cumulative since the start of the vaccination campaign. Thus, the proportion of unvaccinated is overrepresented.</p></a>
<a id="I328" spellcheck><h2>Symptomatic vaccinated statistically unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Statistical data in everyday medical practice on the burden of unvaccinated persons are manipulated in such a way that vaccinated persons who have contracted the virus are simply counted as unvaccinated persons. In this way, the number of unvaccinated is deliberately overrepresented.</p></a>
<a id="I329" spellcheck><h2>Milder courses of illness unproven effect</h2>
<p>The easier course after vaccination is only an unsubstantiated statement for which there are no studies. People who get vaccinated with this hope are misled by political propaganda.</p></a>
<a id="I330" spellcheck><h2>Practically no young people</h2>
<p>Practically no healthy person under the age of 65 dies of corona without serious, relevant previous illnesses. The risk is so negligible at a young age that it outweighs almost all other risks in life - including vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I331" spellcheck><h2>Uncertainty about long-term effects is enough</h2>
<p>Uncertainty about the long-term effects of vaccines is sufficient plausible justification for refusing vaccination. For this reason alone, it is unacceptable to impose social or even legal sanctions on people who decide differently about their bodies.</p></a>
<a id="I332" spellcheck><h2>Not for medical reasons</h2>
<p>Many people get vaccinated for non-medical reasons such as travel and everyday convenience. This is exactly wrong and should never be the reason for a medical intervention.</p></a>
<a id="I333" spellcheck><h2>Understaffing due to exclusion of unvaccinated persons</h2>
<p>In health care, nursing, police and fire departments, capacity is declining dramatically because employees have been required to vaccinate and are quitting. The system is deliberately damaging itself here and causing its own failure.</p></a>
<a id="I334" spellcheck><h2>Streissand effect</h2>
<p>The demonization, censorship and shutdown of alternative media channels is having the opposite effect worldwide due to the scatter sand effect. More and more people are becoming aware of the information that these measures are intended to suppress.</p></a>
<a id="I335" spellcheck><h2>Silence money for relatives</h2>
<p>The official number of vaccination victims is not only distorted by omitted reports in the relevant databases, but also supported by silence payments for relatives of the victims. This is another reason why the numbers of victims are not reliable.</p></a>
<a id="I336" spellcheck><h2>Effective treatment protocols suppressed</h2>
<p>There are successful treatment protocols for the viral disease, but they are hardly used. The reasons for this are organized suppression by instructions from above and by vituperative articles in the media.</p></a>
<a id="I337" spellcheck><h2>Signature for vaccination?</h2>
<p>Has anyone ever had to sign anything when receiving a vaccination? Surely this novel safeguard alone is an indication that there are risks associated with this treatment, where those responsible are trying to absolve themselves of liability.</p></a>
<a id="I338" spellcheck><h2>Studies not double blind</h2>
<p>Third-phase vaccine trials, which are conducted in parallel with the global vaccine rollout by all manufacturers, are not properly double-blinded. Thus, they cannot provide any meaningful results at all.</p></a>
<a id="I339" spellcheck><h2>Control group eliminated</h2>
<p>In vaccine trials conducted in parallel with the worldwide vaccine rollout by all manufacturers, the control group was elimi-nated by vaccine offers long before the planned completion, so that robust results are no longer possible.</p></a>
<a id="I340" spellcheck><h2>Booster with the same vaccine</h2>
<p>So-called booster vaccinations are still carried out with the same vaccine, which is barely effective, although, as with influenza, one would expect adjustments to the new variants before the next vaccination campaign takes place.</p></a>
<a id="I341" spellcheck><h2>Variants usually more harmless</h2>
<p>The narrative of regular new, more dangerous virus variants contradicts the experience that viruses generally become more harmless and less harmful in their mutations, thereby ensuring their own 'survival', among other things.</p></a>
<a id="I342" spellcheck><h2>Gene vaccination but no GMO food?</h2>
<p>Why do you not want to have genetically modified food, but you have no problems with the medical transformation of your own body into a genetically modified organism? In both cases, the argument is that it interferes with nature and that the long-term consequences are unclear?</p></a>
<a id="I343" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination regime puts convalescents in danger</h2>
<p>Pressure and vaccination requirements are putting people around the world who have already survived the virus infection at risk, as they may take unnecessary risks by vaccinating and even weaken their strong immune systems again.</p></a>
<a id="I344" spellcheck><h2>Plato's Allegory of the Cave</h2>
<p>The world currently resembles, as in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, a shadowy land of dumbed-down slaves in a cave that is controlled by elites via false narratives who, however, only want their and our best interests. But they have done the calculation without us!</p></a>
<a id="I345" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination rate unknown and politicized</h2>
<p>The vaccination rate is unknown worldwide due to the lack of appropriate tracking, but is always used by politicians as just needed. A high rate is reported as a sign of success, and the lowest possible rate is reported to animate the population to vaccinate.</p></a>
<a id="I346" spellcheck><h2>Sugar a cause of severe courses</h2>
<p>An important, poorly recognized cause of severe covid progression is elevated blood glucose.  Therefore, glucose management should play a central role in the treatment of covid.</p></a>
<a id="I347" spellcheck><h2>You can't rely on medical care</h2>
<p>Medical care in the event of covid disease cannot be relied upon worldwide, as diverse treatment protocols with proven evidence are not followed and proven harmful therapies are not discouraged.</p></a>
<a id="I348" spellcheck><h2>Monoclonal antibodies</h2>
<p>Treatment of the viral disease with monoclonal antibodies has proven to be very effective. This is a further indication that there have long been sufficient treatment options.</p></a>
<a id="I349" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated just as contagious</h2>
<p>Vaccinated persons are not only similarly infectious due to the same viral load, but also do so for the same length of time as unvaccinated persons. Due to this lack of difference, there is no basis for unequal social treatment of the two groups.</p></a>
<a id="I350" spellcheck><h2>Vulnerable largest vaccination victim group</h2>
<p>The elderly, the previously ill and the immunodeficient make up the lion's share of vaccination victims, although the self-imposed goal of vaccination was to protect precisely these people! This fact alone makes the whole campaign absurd.</p></a>
<a id="I351" spellcheck><h2>Young most unnecessary vaccination victim group</h2>
<p>Young people have an absolutely negligible risk of threatening corona disease. Their vaccination is therefore inappropriate and exposes them to a completely unnecessary, many times higher risk of vaccine side effects and death.</p></a>
<a id="I352" spellcheck><h2>Proper research stupid?</h2>
<p>Isn't it completely irrational to consider people who do extensive research before buying a house or car as smart, but those who do so before an experimental injection as stupid?</p></a>
<a id="I353" spellcheck><h2>No appropriate data on the pandemic</h2>
<p>Even so long after the pandemic began, neither appropriate metrics nor clean data are being collected to assess the pandemic. This is an indication that policy makers are concerned with concerns other than public health.</p></a>
<a id="I354" spellcheck><h2>Incidences still unsuitable data</h2>
<p>Incidence as a pandemic indicator has long been recognized as unsuitable and manipulable, and is nevertheless still used worldwide as the gold standard. This shows that crisis management is not being pursued with any serious scientific ambition.</p></a>
<a id="I355" spellcheck><h2>No interest in clean data</h2>
<p>For the most part, policymakers worldwide seem to have no interest at all in robust and valid data for assessing the pandemic, its risks, and the effectiveness and meaningfulness of prescribed measures.</p></a>
<a id="I356" spellcheck><h2>Secrecy of Pfizer studies</h2>
<p>In the USA, the drug authorities are working with the Pfizer company to keep the data from the approval studies secret from the public for decades. This shows that we are not dealing with righteous actors here.</p></a>
<a id="I357" spellcheck><h2>Increased pulse rate and blood pressure</h2>
<p>There are innumerable reports, especially from sporty active vaccinated persons, about a permanently increased pulse rate and also blood pressure after their vaccination. This points to possibly irreparable damage to their cardiovascular system!</p></a>
<a id="I358" spellcheck><h2>Mengele would be proud</h2>
<p>Joseph Mengele would be proud to learn how, 90 years after the horror of mass medical experimentation in Nazi Germany, the majority of doctors are once again participating in such experiments. Even more so if he would learn that this has now been achieved worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I359" spellcheck><h2>Increase in miscarriages and stillbirths</h2>
<p>Worldwide, there has been a significant increase in miscarriages and stillbirths since the start of vaccination. These figures should have raised the alarm long ago and put the current vaccination practice to the test!</p></a>
<a id="I360" spellcheck><h2>80% useless eaters</h2>
<p>The globalized capitalism with its progressive automation has no more use for 80% of the people in the future. Since they continue to consume scarce resources, the striving for a population reduction by elites is only understandable.</p></a>
<a id="I361" spellcheck><h2>Poorer care for the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>The gradual exclusion of the unvaccinated not only from social life but also from timely and adequate medical care can be observed worldwide. This development of discrimination is caused solely by media agitation!</p></a>
<a id="I362" spellcheck><h2>Brings out old ailments again</h2>
<p>Vaccination has been shown to cause many vaccinated persons to experience an increased return of previous illnesses and of things they thought they had overcome, such as cancer, shingles and nervous disorders. This is a clear indication of still unrecognized harmful properties!</p></a>
<a id="I363" spellcheck><h2>Graphene hydroxide</h2>
<p>There is evidence that the vaccines contain undeclared graphene hydroxide compounds which, when they enter the bloodstream of the vaccinated person, act like razor blades and gradually damage the blood vessels more and more!</p></a>
<a id="I364" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination over-achievers increase rate</h2>
<p>There are many people who, out of excessive concern, get vaccinated more often than recommended, showing up for their "first vaccination" more often than they should with an empty vaccination book. These distort the statistics towards a higher overall vaccination rate.</p></a>
<a id="I365" spellcheck><h2>Protect the protected from the unprotected</h2>
<p>The logic of the progressive vaccination campaign seems to be that the protected must be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to accept protection that is already ineffective on the protected....</p></a>
<a id="I366" spellcheck><h2>Aspiration waived</h2>
<p>On the recommendation of appropriate authorities, aspiration is not used for vaccination, which would help to exclude intravascular injection, i.e. into the bloodstream. It is incomprehensible why such a simple procedure is dispensed with.</p></a>
<a id="I367" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination in the bloodstream dangerous</h2>
<p>There is evidence that vaccination produces increased harmful side effects particularly when the injection is intravascular, i.e., partially enters the bloodstream. This finding alone should lead to changes in the process.</p></a>
<a id="I368" spellcheck><h2>Few particularly harmful batches</h2>
<p>Research by the U.S. VAERS adverse event database has shown that there are a small proportion of batches of all vaccines that are orders of magnitude more harmful or lethal. This observation alone should lead to a halt in vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="I369" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines only with exemption from liability</h2>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers first protect themselves from liability in each country before vaccine is made available to nationals. This is also evident, for example, in the vaccination of refugees.</p></a>
<a id="I370" spellcheck><h2>Marx's Bold Capital</h2>
<p>Big Pharma can be explained with Marx: 'With appropriate profit, capital becomes bold. 10% sure, it can be applied anywhere; 20%, it becomes lively; 50%, positively reckless; for 100% it tramples all human laws; 300%, and no crime exists that it does not risk...'</p></a>
<a id="I371" spellcheck><h2>Ivermectin successful in Japan</h2>
<p>Ivermectin has been shown to be effective against covid in many studies and in practice. In Japan, it is successfully used to control the disease.</p></a>
<a id="I372" spellcheck><h2>Book &lsquo;The Real Anthony Fauci&rsquo;</h2>
<p>'The Real Anthony Fauci' exposes the same as a decades-long active mastermind in government service for the unscrupulous enforcement of pharmaceutical interests by means of artificial threat scenarios, who also has decisive influence in the Corona crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I373" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated blamed for ineffectiveness?</h2>
<p>This is the first time in history that the failure of a medication to work is blamed on those who did not take it. One would not demand that others apply suntan lotion so that one does not get sunburned oneself.</p></a>
<a id="I374" spellcheck><h2>Skip first three vaccinations?</h2>
<p>Can I skip the first three vaccines and the fourth will work or do I have to take the first three non-working ones first for the fourth to work? Question for a friend.</p></a>
<a id="I375" spellcheck><h2>Clearly a mass psychosis</h2>
<p>Corona crisis resembles a mass psychosis in which a large part loses touch with reality and sinks into delusions. And that these are skillfully stoked so that the individual voluntarily gives up his rights and needs in blind obedience.</p></a>
<a id="I376" spellcheck><h2>Doctors used to be more cautious about vaccinations</h2>
<p>In the past, doctors were much more cautious about vaccinations, especially for pregnant women. Despite the relatively very high rate of side effects, there is no longer any evidence of this caution.</p></a>
<a id="I377" spellcheck><h2>Early treatment systematically blocked</h2>
<p>Covid early treatment solutions are systematically blocked to protect the vaccine market. This practice has also massively increased the number of victims and is tantamount to organized murder.</p></a>
<a id="I378" spellcheck><h2>Natural immunity much more effective</h2>
<p>Natural immunity to the Corona virus is many times more effective than vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore, it is counterproductive to prescribe it for everyone even with a healthy immune system.</p></a>
<a id="I379" spellcheck><h2>Evolution of viruses into less dangerous</h2>
<p>Respiratory viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, follow the laws of evolution and become more and more infectious but also less and less dangerous. Without human intervention, the variant that spreads most easily will prevail.</p></a>
<a id="I380" spellcheck><h2>It only ends when we end it</h2>
<p>The alleged Corona crisis will only end if the majority consciously lets it end. This crisis offers its powerful perpetrators too many advantages and opportunities for influence for them to voluntarily give up this state of affairs.</p></a>
<a id="I381" spellcheck><h2>Health insurance covers everybody</h2>
<p>The solidarity-based pay-as-you-go system of health insurance is calculated for all risky lifestyles, including riding motorcycles, smoking and eating bad food. There is no reason to exclude a supposed risk group, the unvaccinated, and treat them separately.</p></a>
<a id="I382" spellcheck><h2>Red hand letters of the manufacturers</h2>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers have long since admitted the harmful effects of their products and made them public via the so-called Red Hand Letters. Only hardly anything about it gets through to the public.</p></a>
<a id="I383" spellcheck><h2>Nano-lipids for research purposes only</h2>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the nanolipids used for encapsulation in all mRNA vaccines may only be used for research purposes. The fact that these were nevertheless approved shows how criminally risks are handled here.</p></a>
<a id="I384" spellcheck><h2>No proof of effectiveness of vaccination</h2>
<p>To date, there is no reliable scientific evidence that vaccinations work and save lives. Nevertheless, this claim is regularly made by politicians, doctors and the media and misleads people.</p></a>
<a id="I385" spellcheck><h2>Much evidence for the harmfulness of vaccination</h2>
<p>There is a lot of scientific evidence of the harmfulness of vaccination and the risk of dying from vaccination is tens of times higher than dying from the disease. The industry and many other protagonists have known this for a long time and still continue.</p></a>
<a id="I386" spellcheck><h2>Many more athletes collapse</h2>
<p>The number of athletes who develop health problems, collapse during sports and also die has increased dramatically since the vaccination campaign began. The number of FIFA players who have dropped out in this way alone is a clearly measurable indication.</p></a>
<a id="I387" spellcheck><h2>Empty social coffers relieved by vaccination victims</h2>
<p>Death by vaccination is accepted, especially among the elderly, or is even desired by politicians in order to relieve the empty pension and retirement funds. Sick and weakened people also no longer rebel when benefits to which they are entitled fail.</p></a>
<a id="I388" spellcheck><h2>Nothing to see in casualty figures</h2>
<p>Covid casualty rates worldwide do not exceed the usual statistical range of respiratory disease deaths. There is simply nothing to see or regret here.</p></a>
<a id="I389" spellcheck><h2>Science vs. scientists</h2>
<p>The 'trusting science' should never be confused with 'trusting the scientist'. For science is objective and factual, while scientists can sell themselves to the highest bidder.</p></a>
<a id="I390" spellcheck><h2>Lancet gate shows foul play</h2>
<p>The Lancet study on the danger of hydroxychloroquine, which was later withdrawn, shows how science is misused for interests. Because the WHO stopped further use worldwide, countless people have died completely unnecessarily from covid.</p></a>
<a id="I391" spellcheck><h2>Denunciation</h2>
<p>The implementation of the many Corona measures is only possible for the state if people can be found to denounce others. But this is just as in the dark past in most countries around the world, unfortunately, an easy task.</p></a>
<a id="I392" spellcheck><h2>Graphene oxide in the vaccines</h2>
<p>One can assume from scientific publications and examinations of the vaccines that graphene oxide is contained. And that this ingredient is not officially declared by any of the manufacturers.</p></a>
<a id="I393" spellcheck><h2>Fear feeds Corona</h2>
<p>Anxiety disorders are among the strongest risk factors for severe covid disease. Immune defense is closely linked to mental state, and this is where the panic fueled by politics and the media clearly has its effect.</p></a>
<a id="I394" spellcheck><h2>Blood coagulation disorders / D-dimers</h2>
<p>In a large proportion of vaccinated persons, blood coagulation is worsened after vaccination. This effect can also be determined with a so-called coagulation laboratory via the D-dimers.</p></a>
<a id="I395" spellcheck><h2>Politician Theatre Everywhere</h2>
<p>Politicians and officials were convicted by photo and video recordings of the Corona Theater. If the politicians do not take seriously their self-imposed measures on distance and masks, how should the population?</p></a>
<a id="I396" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination does not reach the mucous membranes</h2>
<p>The best place to strengthen the immune system against resiratory viruses is the mucous membranes. Unfortunately, the Corona vaccines exert their effect in other parts of the body.</p></a>
<a id="I397" spellcheck><h2>EU 4.4 billion cans pre-ordered</h2>
<p>The EU has already pre-ordered vaccines in an amount that would be sufficient for all EU citizens for many years. This is a clear indication that this is a long-term 'program' and not a pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="I398" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theory vs. reality?</h2>
<p>What is the difference between conspiracy theory and reality in Corona times? The answer is more and more often: 'only a few months' - for example in child vaccination, compulsory vaccination, quarantine camps, segregation and vaccination subscription.</p></a>
<a id="I399" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine breakthrough = not working</h2>
<p>The term vaccine breakthrough is just a friendly euphemism for the fact that vaccines simply do not work - and another example of linguistic manipulation or neologism.</p></a>
<a id="I400" spellcheck><h2>Pharma companies worse than the Mafia</h2>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies have a long, quasi-mafia history of human experimentation and fraud, which only remained without consequences due to lobbying and payments in the billions. It is precisely these corporations that have finally taken control of our lives via the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I401" spellcheck><h2>Quarantine camp already prepared</h2>
<p>Quarantine camps are being set up on a large scale worldwide and are already being used in Australia, for example. These preparations clearly indicate that the crisis is expected to last for years.</p></a>
<a id="I402" spellcheck><h2>Definition vaccine changed</h2>
<p>The pharmaceutical manufacturers have succeeded in officially watering down the concept of a vaccine to such an extent that it no longer has to provide any kind of immunity. With this definition, any drug could actually be called a vaccine.</p></a>
<a id="I403" spellcheck><h2>Term Vaccine redefined</h2>
<p>The CDC has unceremoniously withdrawn the PCR test process as a valid method for detecting Sars-Cov-2. This comes with the official admission that this test cannot even differentiate between Corona and other viruses.</p></a>
<a id="I404" spellcheck><h2>Fact checker officially opinion only</h2>
<p>The company Facebook has admitted in court that their so-called fact checkers do not represent scientific truths, but are merely opinions of their authors. This can also be assumed to be the case for all other fact checkers.</p></a>
<a id="I405" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated pilots particularly at risk</h2>
<p>Due to their working environment, pilots are already exposed to increased risks of thrombosis and infarction under normal circumstances. For Corona-vaccinated pilots, this risk is increased even further, which is already reflected in correspondingly higher casualty figures.</p></a>
<a id="I406" spellcheck><h2>Nano lipids produce inflammation</h2>
<p>It has now been proven that, in addition to the spike proteins, the nano-lipids with which the mRNA in the vaccines is coated also trigger life-threatening inflammations in the body. With this knowledge, the vaccines must be withdrawn from circulation as quickly as possible.</p></a>
<a id="I407" spellcheck><h2>Nano-lipids not approved for humans</h2>
<p>The mRNA vaccines may never be approved due to their ingredients, as the lipids used may only be used for research purposes according to the manufacturer. And that the regulatory authorities worldwide have simply overlooked this.</p></a>
<a id="I408" spellcheck><h2>Inappropriate police violence at demos</h2>
<p>Around the world, demonstrations by critics of Corona's policies are met with inappropriate police violence, which is intended to deter and appears politically motivated. This violence is covered by authorities, politics and even courts.</p></a>
<a id="I409" spellcheck><h2>Dr. Robert Malone in the crosshairs</h2>
<p>Dr. Robert Malone, as one of the co-inventors of mRNA technology, has taken a critical stance on vaccinations and is now being massively censored and defamed by the tech companies. And that at the latest here it must be clear to everyone that it is not about science.</p></a>
<a id="I410" spellcheck><h2>Singing allowed, dancing forbidden?</h2>
<p>Every rational person must be aware of the absurdity and obvious ineffectiveness of most of the measures imposed worldwide. The many interest-driven exceptions alone are treacherous.</p></a>
<a id="I411" spellcheck><h2>Scientific discourse is still ongoing</h2>
<p>The scientific situation on most Corona issues is by no means as clear-cut as mass media and selected government advisors make it out to be. The scientific discourse is still in full swing.</p></a>
<a id="I412" spellcheck><h2>The wrath of the vaccinated will come</h2>
<p>When the crisis is over, politicians and experts will face the wrath of the vaccinated. They will attribute their own suffering directly to the vaccination pressure to which they were subjected by them.</p></a>
<a id="I413" spellcheck><h2>Over when we stop participating</h2>
<p>The two camps fighting each other will never end the crisis. It will be over as soon as the majority stops going along with the prescribed measures.</p></a>
<a id="I414" spellcheck><h2>The 14 days are the trick</h2>
<p>The official stipulation that vaccination and boosters should not be effective until after 14 days is used to statistically account for the many immediate vaccine victims and deaths as unvaccinated or even Corona victims.</p></a>
<a id="I415" spellcheck><h2>Anti-protest ordinances everywhere</h2>
<p>A pattern is emerging around the world in which legal freedom of assembly is being undermined by ordinances and police violence. In this way, resistance to the Corona regime is to be suppressed.</p></a>
<a id="I416" spellcheck><h2>Telegram is democracy in action</h2>
<p>Telegram is also used for a lot of bad things, but it is important for democratic opposition worldwide. It ensures freedom of expression, which we can't do without in a democracy.</p></a>
<a id="I417" spellcheck><h2> Life insurance companies refuse payment</h2>
<p>More and more cases are coming to light in which life insurance companies are refusing to pay out after a vaccination death. They justify this on the grounds that the treatment was experimental and not prescribed by the state.</p></a>
<a id="I418" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinations more Covid!</h2>
<p>It has long been statistically proven that worldwide, as the vaccination rate increases, the number of covid cases also continues to increase! Vaccination actually produces the disease it claims to fight.</p></a>
<a id="I419" spellcheck><h2>Only believed promises</h2>
<p>The vast majority of those vaccinated merely believed the politicians' promises of freedom or bowed to pressure and thus acted not out of conviction but in the hope that the measures would end.</p></a>
<a id="I420" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine instead of vaccination card black market</h2>
<p>If we had a real pandemic and the vaccine worked, there would be vaccine for sale on the black market instead of fake vaccination cards. This fact shows what people are really afraid of.</p></a>
<a id="I421" spellcheck><h2>Like mafia protection money</h2>
<p>Those who claim that those who go along with the Corona measures can be counted as supporters probably also mean that those who pay protection money extorted by the mafia welcome their protection measures.</p></a>
<a id="I422" spellcheck><h2>Don't Look Up</h2>
<p>The film 'Don't look up' is an artistic parable on current situation in which we are so manipulated that we have voluntarily given our fate into the hands of unscrupulous interest groups - and in the end pay the price for it.</p></a>
<a id="I423" spellcheck><h2>Treatment protocols kill</h2>
<p>Despite much evidence about appropriate treatments worldwide, many physicians still follow treatment protocols for covid patients that harm them. These are still responsible for a significant proportion of covid victims.</p></a>
<a id="I424" spellcheck><h2>From clapping to sacking</h2>
<p>The same health care workers who not long ago were publicly applauded for their efforts during the crisis now face dismissal in part because of their vaccination status.</p></a>
<a id="I425" spellcheck><h2>Stockholm Syndrome</h2>
<p>The blind obedience and unshakable trust of the majority of the population in the repressive strategies and measures for crisis management can no longer be considered anything other than Stockholm syndrome.</p></a>
<a id="I426" spellcheck><h2>Deliberate destruction</h2>
<p>The actions of politicians worldwide, such as dismissing nurses, police and truck drivers because of their vaccination status is tantamount to deliberately destroying functioning social structures.</p></a>
<a id="I427" spellcheck><h2>Authorities threaten doctors</h2>
<p>Health authorities threaten and blackmail physicians into not granting exemptions for masks or vaccinations and thus impermissibly interfere with physicians' freedom of treatment. This pressure clearly does not serve general health.</p></a>
<a id="I428" spellcheck><h2>My freedom and your fear</h2>
<p>My freedom does not end where the fear of others begins. The issue here is not that different freedoms are opposed to each other, but different perceptions of risk.</p></a>
<a id="I429" spellcheck><h2>Conflicts of interest</h2>
<p>Many of the key politicians, scientists officials and media pushing the corona measures and vaccination agenda have demonstrable conflicts of interest. As a rule, links to the pharmaceutical industry can be demonstrated.</p></a>
<a id="I430" spellcheck><h2>Boosters further weakens immune system</h2>
<p>Each additional Corona vaccination further weakens the immune system of the vaccinated. This weakening occurs, among other things, because the own defense is specialized by the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I431" spellcheck><h2>Disease strengthens immune system</h2>
<p>The time-honored wisdom that going through an illness strengthens the immune system still holds true.  In fact, this type of immunization is the most effective and slowest lasting there is.</p></a>
<a id="I432" spellcheck><h2>Coronaviruses mutate too much</h2>
<p>Coronaviruses mutate far too strongly to be combated by targeted vaccination. Meanwhile, less effective vaccines are constantly being administered that were actually developed for a different variant.</p></a>
<a id="I433" spellcheck><h2>How many boosters are you still taking?</h2>
<p>How many booster shots will you get before you quit the vaccination madness? The endless loop will end at some point anyway: with the first serious side effect or death.</p></a>
<a id="I434" spellcheck><h2>Only Gauls left</h2>
<p>Governments around the world have set unattainable goals for their vaccination quotas, because the remaining vaccination unwilling are conviction offenders. They can be compared to the indomitable Gauls in Asterix.</p></a>
<a id="I435" spellcheck><h2>Demonstrate for you with</h2>
<p>We demonstrate for those who still cling to the official announcements and narratives and hope for a regular end of the crisis. In the end, everyone will take to the streets anyway.</p></a>
<a id="I436" spellcheck><h2>Already write will</h2>
<p>Those who want to continue with every booster vaccination should already write their will. Because, as in Russian roulette, one of the coming vaccinations will inevitably mean the end of them.</p></a>
<a id="I437" spellcheck><h2>The microbe is nothing, the environment is everything</h2>
<p>Antoine Béchamp's insight that the condition of the host is primarily responsible for the development of disease is still valid. Even his adversary Pasteur had to agree with him in the end.</p></a>
<a id="I438" spellcheck><h2>More and more vaccinated people regret the injection</h2>
<p>More and more vaccinated people are repenting of their vaccination because they realize that, on the one hand, it has rather harmed their bodies and, on the other hand, they are being asked to do it over and over again. The repentant will bring this policy down in the end.</p></a>
<a id="I439" spellcheck><h2>MIS/PIMS through vaccination</h2>
<p>Vaccination triggers multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS or PIMS) in the body of many vaccinees, especially children. This effect of vaccination, like other side effects, is falsely attributed to Covid disease.</p></a>
<a id="I440" spellcheck><h2>Moving Goalposts</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, politicians have changed the goals of their measures countless times without scientific evidence, such as the vaccination rate to be achieved. They are obviously interested in maintaining the state of emergency for longer!</p></a>
<a id="I441" spellcheck><h2>Radiation interacts with the vaccine</h2>
<p>As a superconductor, graphene oxide reacts to radiation in the body of vaccinated persons and produces damage in the body through its vibrations. Vaccinated persons are therefore in mortal danger in the vicinity of e.g. radio transmission masts.</p></a>
<a id="I442" spellcheck><h2>Should do AIDS test</h2>
<p>Those who have had the third mRNA dose should go to a laboratory and take an AIDS test. The result will surprise them, because this usually reacts positively to administered DNA fragments.</p></a>
<a id="I443" spellcheck><h2>Censorship prevents informed consent</h2>
<p>The informed consent of the patient, which is obligatory for medical treatments, is made impossible by massive censorship in connection with vaccination. This is a gigantic crime against humanity.</p></a>
<a id="I444" spellcheck><h2>Nanotech in vaccine</h2>
<p>Microscopic images of all available vaccines show undeclared components of unknown function that appear to be technological artifacts. The manufacturers owe the public an explanation for this.</p></a>
<a id="I445" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine leads to VAIDS</h2>
<p>Vaccines bring with them a new syndrome related to AIDS in the form of a disturbed and weakened immune system. This will not only perpetuate the crisis, but also the profits of the pharmaceutical industry.</p></a>
<a id="I446" spellcheck><h2>They don't give up the reins</h2>
<p>The conspirators, who have elaborately prepared the crisis to advance their interests, will not be impressed by the resistance. They can still play out many options to continue the state of emergency.</p></a>
<a id="I447" spellcheck><h2>False vaccination certificates show defense</h2>
<p>The high number of falsified vaccination certificates shows that in real terms many people cannot be forced to vaccinate. The statistical discrepancies indicate a large invisible resistance.</p></a>
<a id="I448" spellcheck><h2>Always new explanations for side effects</h2>
<p>Currently, the craziest explanations for heart problems and attacks are circulating in the media. The only explanation you never read is the most obvious one: That they are foldal side effects of the vaccination!</p></a>
<a id="I449" spellcheck><h2>DNA fingerprints are stored</h2>
<p>DNA obtained from PCR swabs is sold and stored indefinitely as an individual DNA fingerprint. It can be used as part of a biometric control infrastructure like in the movie Gatacca.</p></a>
<a id="I450" spellcheck><h2>Unified pandemic response installed</h2>
<p>It has long since been cemented worldwide via committees that the pandemic threat issue will be preserved in perpetuity. Without resistance, there can be no hope of ever returning to a lasting normalization of life.</p></a>
<a id="I451" spellcheck><h2>Canadian trucker is global way out</h2>
<p>The Canadian trucker protest has set an example of how to put governments around the world in their place with their repressive regulations. The imitators will get us out of this dystopian aberration.</p></a>
<a id="I452" spellcheck><h2>Masks are obedience symbol</h2>
<p>Masks were intended from the beginning as a symbol of submission and obedience of the population. Mask decrees only serve to further falsely suggest a danger and exceptional situation to the people.</p></a>
<a id="I453" spellcheck><h2>Random testing too error-prone</h2>
<p>Given the error rates, regular testing in schools cannot be a sensible measure. On the contrary, this approach only ensures that people constantly become problem cases unnecessarily and unjustifiably.</p></a>
<a id="I454" spellcheck><h2>Postponed is not canceled</h2>
<p>Governments around the world are always comprehensively withdrawing previously enacted regulations and measures, but this is only ever done for a limited time. Without massive resistance, they will never disappear completely.</p></a>
<a id="I455" spellcheck><h2>Normalization of side effect symptoms</h2>
<p>Known side effects of vaccination, such as thrombosis and heart problems, are increasingly being described in the media as normal everyday problems or put into other contexts. These diversionary tactics only delay the clarification.</p></a>
<a id="I456" spellcheck><h2>Want my friends and helpers back</h2>
<p>I want the police to regain the self-image of being a friend and helper from before the crisis. The police cannot be misused for the implementation of state interests instead of those of the citizens.</p></a>
<a id="I457" spellcheck><h2>Fearful faction radicalized</h2>
<p>The social faction with the most pronounced fears has become increasingly radicalized via demands for the most repressive measures and punishments - and is given uncritical space for its theses in mass media.</p></a>
<a id="I458" spellcheck><h2>Two minorities</h2>
<p>In reality, there is not one, but two radical minorities - the vast majority just want to have their peace. The mass media largely act according to the fearful minority.</p></a>
<a id="I459" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is like Russian roulette</h2>
<p>Obviously, there are different problematic batches and, moreover, the vaccine can enter the bloodstream without aspiration. Therefore, one can justifiably speak of a Russian roulette.</p></a>
<a id="I460" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination risks increase with each booster</h2>
<p>Each additional Corona vaccination further increases the risk of severe side effects or even death for those vaccinated. The reason for this, among others, is that more and more harmful and undeclared ingredients enter the body.</p></a>
<a id="I461" spellcheck><h2>Abolish Nuremberg Code</h2>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen, as President of the EU Commission, has called for the abolition of the Nuremberg Code. This demand shows the inhuman force with which the new order is to be enforced.</p></a>
<a id="I462" spellcheck><h2>Aborted fetuses for vaccine</h2>
<p>In the production of certain vaccines, cells of aborted fetuses are used because of their great reproductive capacity. Here, criticism and rejection is fully justified, not only by people of faith.</p></a>
<a id="I463" spellcheck><h2>Opinion from incomplete fakes</h2>
<p>You cannot form an independent opinion on incomplete facts. Anyone who relies one-sidedly on mass media reporting does not have a sufficient basis for forming an opinion on the Corona issue.</p></a>
<a id="I464" spellcheck><h2>Journalistic standards not met</h2>
<p>Journalists have regularly violated journalistic standards (not only) since the beginning of the Corona crisis. These media representatives are partly responsible for the development - and also for the social divide.</p></a>
<a id="I465" spellcheck><h2>Childhood Immunization Has Hidden Agenda</h2>
<p>The high pressure with which vaccine manufacturers are pushing the vaccination of children is mainly due to regulatory reasons: Depending on the country, manufacturers are exempt from liability precisely when their vaccine is also recommended for children.</p></a>
<a id="I466" spellcheck><h2>Titanium dioxide in masks</h2>
<p>Especially white masks are coated with the toxic substance titanium dioxide for whitening. Masks have been partially withdrawn, but there are still enough harmful masks in circulation and being sold.</p></a>
<a id="I467" spellcheck><h2>General failure of the left</h2>
<p>The Left has failed globally in the Corona Crisis because they have not recognized the corrupt takeover of power by the global financial, digital and pharmaceutical industries as such. Thus they have made themselves completely superfluous for their clientele.</p></a>
<a id="I468" spellcheck><h2>Ethylene oxide carcinogenic in tests</h2>
<p>The cotton swabs of many tests are sterilized with ethylene oxide, which is a carcinogenic substance. The massive use of these tests is therefore harmful, especially for children who need to be tested regularly.</p></a>
<a id="I469" spellcheck><h2>Protests are peaceful</h2>
<p>The Corona protests worldwide are completely peaceful, despite media reports to the contrary. And the demands for peace, freedom and bodily self-determination, for example, are legitimate, non-violent and anti-authoritarian.</p></a>
<a id="I470" spellcheck><h2>Protesters from the bourgeois spectrum</h2>
<p>Participants in Corona protests are often portrayed in the media as violent extremists, but in reality they come predominantly from the middle-class spectrum. This classification serves primarily to exclude them.</p></a>
<a id="I471" spellcheck><h2>Agent Provocateurs</h2>
<p>Agent provocateurs brought in by the authorities repeatedly cause disturbances at protests, which then justify police interventions. The protests are thus falsely framed in the media as violent and aggressive.</p></a>
<a id="I472" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinations are big business</h2>
<p>Vaccinations, both in general and in the specific Corona context, are first and foremost big business for physicians. Pediatricians in particular often generate much of their income from these treatments.</p></a>
<a id="I473" spellcheck><h2>Officially no third-party protection</h2>
<p>In the meantime, official government agencies no longer assume that vaccinations provide protection for others. This also means that there is no longer any basis for any exclusions and ultimately for compulsory vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I474" spellcheck><h2>Professional ban for doctors critical of vaccination</h2>
<p>In many countries, physicians who take a critical stance on vaccination are threatened with professional bans. This is unlawful and also contradicts physicians' freedom of therapy and treatment.</p></a>
<a id="I475" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates &lsquo;sadly&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Bill Gates actually expressed sadness at the Munich Security Conference that the global immunization of the population through viral contact has proceeded faster than the rollout of the vaccine.</p></a>
<a id="I476" spellcheck><h2>Experiments on protesters</h2>
<p>Authorities in some countries misuse Corona demonstrators as an experimental field for warfare agents and weapons, e.g. sonic weapons. This is done completely illegally and is a clear indication of abuse of power.</p></a>
<a id="I477" spellcheck><h2>Corona policy belongs in court</h2>
<p>Corona policies and actions are not evidence-based in almost every country in the world, while violating fundamental and human rights. The responsible politicians belong before a court of law.</p></a>
<a id="I478" spellcheck><h2>WHO Power Grab</h2>
<p>The WHO concludes agreements with its member countries that give WHO specifications precedence over local constitutions in the event of a pandemic. This power grab finally transforms the world into a centralized, corrupt technocracy.</p></a>
<a id="I479" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine adverse event epidemic</h2>
<p>Case data clearly show that the ongoing Corona epidemic is really a vaccine adverse event epidemic. The symptoms of vaccine damage and disease are largely indistinguishable.</p></a>
<a id="I480" spellcheck><h2>The more they talk, the more they betray themselves</h2>
<p>Politicians and officials who stand for the Corona narrative worldwide betray themselves more with every new, contradictory statement. Therefore, one only has to wait until the last one realizes that we are being fooled.</p></a>
<a id="I481" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory vaccination is for vaccinated</h2>
<p>The general vaccination obligation is sold as being directed against the unvaccinated, but in reality it is there to force those who have already been vaccinated into permanent treatment. The unvaccinated already know how to avoid the coercion.</p></a>
<a id="I482" spellcheck><h2>Children long since &lsquo;contaminated&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Data worldwide show that strong natural immunity has long been present in children. Therefore, neither the enforcement of strict rules nor that of childhood vaccination is medically indicated.</p></a>
<a id="I483" spellcheck><h2>Coercion of children to vaccinate</h2>
<p>Governments worldwide coerce immature children through regulations and campaigns to harm themselves through vaccination. Parents are condemned to stand by or come into conflict with authorities and state power.</p></a>
<a id="I484" spellcheck><h2>Insurance companies see the extent</h2>
<p>Health and life insurance companies worldwide have long had alarming data on the extent of vaccine adverse events and deaths. This data is only suppressed as long as possible to preserve the narrative.</p></a>
<a id="I485" spellcheck><h2>Ukraine war serves as a distraction</h2>
<p>During the Ukraine war, vaccination obligations and uniform vaccination certificates are implemented worldwide without much fuss. The war distracts from the fact that a global hygiene totalitarianism is being installed.</p></a>
<a id="I486" spellcheck><h2>Freedom is not an encore</h2>
<p>In democratic societies, freedom is not a generously granted addition or a cherry on the cake, but a principle that must always apply, no matter how great the danger.</p></a>
<a id="I487" spellcheck><h2>Side effects not a sign of efficacy</h2>
<p>The claim that symptoms such as fever, headache or vomiting are a sign of the desired immune response is completely false. This myth is disproved by the BioNTech/Pfizer Phase 1 results.</p></a>
<a id="I488" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates Population Control</h2>
<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started as the 'Institute for Population Control' and a clear core interest has remained population control through drugs and vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="I489" spellcheck><h2>Covid already proven before 2020</h2>
<p>The virus, as well as antibodies to it, have been detected in samples from long before the official outbreak. These facts alone refute the story of Wuhan as the starting point of the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I490" spellcheck><h2>No-Covid Self-Destructive Ideology</h2>
<p>The idea that you can prevent the spread of the virus by taking rigorous action against your own population is an unscientific and self-defeating ideology that must be urgently stopped.</p></a>
<a id="I491" spellcheck><h2>Better to wear helmets than masks</h2>
<p>If it were a matter of proportionate risk management, people would be better off wearing helmets instead of masks. Death by meteorite impact has become more likely than death by covid.</p></a>
<a id="I492" spellcheck><h2>All governments infiltrated</h2>
<p>Klaus Schwab has expressed pride that the WEF has successfully 'penetrated' governments worldwide with Young Global Leaders. And that half of Canada's cabinet now consists of them.</p></a>
<a id="I493" spellcheck><h2>Developmental disorders in children</h2>
<p>Masking and spacing rules in schools and kindergartens cause serious developmental disruptions due to a lack of experience, among other things. In some cases, only limited time windows are available for certain developmental steps.</p></a>
<a id="I494" spellcheck><h2>Increasingly anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders</h2>
<p>Due to the viral danger communicated on all channels, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders are developing more and more frequently in both children and adults. The social damage triggered by this is hardly recorded.</p></a>
<a id="I495" spellcheck><h2>mRNA modifies own DNA</h2>
<p>It has now been proven that the mRNA introduced into the human body by vaccination directly alters the body's own DNA. Therefore, one can already firmly assume unforeseeable long-term consequences.</p></a>
<a id="I496" spellcheck><h2>Chomsky's Narrowed Corridor of Opinion</h2>
<p>Around the topics of criticism of measures and vaccination, an extremely narrow corridor of opinion has been erected everywhere, in some cases threatening the very existence of the community. Meanwhile, even Chomsky himself is a victim of this phenomenon he described.</p></a>
<a id="I497" spellcheck><h2>Doctors no longer know what to do</h2>
<p>We hear more and more frequently that doctors are at a loss when it comes to patients' health problems or cannot find a cause. Typically, they always want to rule out one cause: Vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I498" spellcheck><h2>Records declassified</h2>
<p>The US FDA had to release the approval documents for the Pfizer vaccine after a successful lawsuit. Previously, it had wanted to withhold these documents for decades without good justification.</p></a>
<a id="I499" spellcheck><h2>9 pages side effects</h2>
<p>The Pfizer vaccine's marketing authorization documents, which have been released, contain, among other things, nine small-print pages listing common - more than 2% - side effects. These show that the manufacturer knew of the danger.</p></a>
<a id="I500" spellcheck><h2>500 million people</h2>
<p>Elitist eugenicist circles have already made clear via the Georgia Guidestones how they want to 'save the world'. One of the core goals is to reduce the world population to 500 million people.</p></a>
<a id="I501" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination premeditated mass murder</h2>
<p>The severe side effects were known in detail to both Pfizer and the FDA before the vaccine was introduced. The implementation of the vaccination is therefore tantamount to premeditated mass murder, crimes against humanity and genocide.</p></a>
<a id="I502" spellcheck><h2>Digital vaccination certificates switched off at the touch of a button</h2>
<p>Anyone who relies on their digital vaccination certificate for further participation in society is not safe from arbitrary government action. More and more countries are forcing their citizens to undergo further vaccinations by invalidating these certificates.</p></a>
<a id="I503" spellcheck><h2>mRNA technology choice &lsquo;counterintuitive&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Pfizer CEO Bourla has stated in an interview that the decision to go with mRNA vaccine technology was 'counterintuitive' because there was the least experience with it. And that he himself was very surprised by this path.</p></a>
<a id="I504" spellcheck><h2>Weak immune system Vaccinated danger for all</h2>
<p>Because the immune system of vaccinated people is much weaker, viruses of all kinds can circulate more easily overall. This circumstance thus becomes a problem for unvaccinated people as well, regardless of Corona.</p></a>
<a id="I505" spellcheck><h2>Accelerated aging process in vaccinated individuals</h2>
<p>Bodies of vaccinated people experience accelerated aging because the genetic repair mechanism is destroyed by vaccination. About this monstrosity will have statistical certainty in a few years.</p></a>
<a id="I506" spellcheck><h2>Do you know what's in the vaccine?</h2>
<p>Do you know what is in the vaccines? I say that no one, who would have been honestly informed about the ingredients, would have decided for a vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I507" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people have a much higher viral load</h2>
<p>On average, vaccinated patients have a viral load that is hundreds of times higher than that of unvaccinated patients. Therefore, contrary to what is claimed, they pose a much greater risk of infection to their fellow human beings.</p></a>
<a id="I508" spellcheck><h2>Thinking about illness makes you sick</h2>
<p>If you constantly worry about illness, you will end up getting sick. The media emphasis on Corona has turned many people into hypochondriacs who now live with a constant fear for their health.</p></a>
<a id="I509" spellcheck><h2>What about Shanghai?</h2>
<p>The Chinese government is now keeping its population in a mass experiment of fear, hunger and isolation with totalitarian measures. The ongoing lockdown in Shanghai already shows what the rest of the world will soon be facing.</p></a>
<a id="I510" spellcheck><h2>Medicine corrupted by interests</h2>
<p>Evidence-based medicine has become so corrupted by corporate interests, failed regulation, and the commercialization of academia that it can no longer be trusted. The Corona crisis has only made this fact more visible.</p></a>
<a id="I511" spellcheck><h2>Microplastics from masks in the lungs</h2>
<p>During operations, microplastic particles from masks have already been found in the lung tissue of many people. More and more new damage that can be done to one's body by constantly wearing masks is becoming public.</p></a>
<a id="I512" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination side effects are trivialized</h2>
<p>A societal aberration has been established in which drastic vaccination side effects are ignored or trivialized. We have come a long way from responsible behavior to a gigantic self-deception.</p></a>
<a id="I513" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated pilots are a safety risk</h2>
<p>Pilots who have been forced to be vaccinated by their airlines suffer more frequently from heart problems or even have heart attacks in the cockpit. They have thus become a safety risk and unfit for their job.</p></a>
<a id="I514" spellcheck><h2>Pfizer's side effects task force</h2>
<p>Pfizer received so many adverse event reports during their pivotal trial that they had to hire thousands of additional employees to process them. This shows how irresponsible the emergency approval was.</p></a>
<a id="I515" spellcheck><h2>Hariri reveals surveillance agenda</h2>
<p>Yuval Noah Harari regularly reveals in interviews where the Corona Crisis is meant to lead people: into the acceptance and legitimization of total biometric surveillance. One only has to listen to understand the agenda.</p></a>
<a id="I516" spellcheck><h2>Schwab Bond villain made real</h2>
<p>Klaus Schwab appears and speaks like a real Bond villain. The megalomania that becomes apparent in connection with the real influence of his comrades-in-arms on our future should worry every sensible person.</p></a>
<a id="I517" spellcheck><h2>Doctors cannot admit to vaccine damage</h2>
<p>Physicians who administer vaccinations cannot even admit to vaccination side effects and deaths, otherwise they could be held directly responsible. But looking the other way violates all medical principles.</p></a>
<a id="I518" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines are not regularly licensed</h2>
<p>In the meantime, it has become apparent that the vaccines do not receive regular approval, but nevertheless continue to be administered on a mandatory basis via emergency regulations. For this purpose, protective mechanisms are being criminally undermined worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I519" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theorist now honorary title</h2>
<p>The pejorative label of 'conspiracy theorist' for critical people is turning more into a positive honorific title with each incoming prediction. Apologies on a personal, political and media level are overdue.</p></a>
<a id="I520" spellcheck><h2>Booster ineffective due to antigenic original sin</h2>
<p>Due to the so-called "antigenic original sin", only more antibodies against the original version of the coronavirus are produced, even if an omicron booster is vaccinated. Therefore, "adapted" vaccines hardly achieve better protective effects.</p></a>
<a id="I521" spellcheck><h2>Mask marks subordinates</h2>
<p>If in the travel, culture and gastronomy sector only employees have to wear masks, but not the guests, that must seem like submission to them. With these regulations one is again with feudalism and class society.</p></a>
<a id="I522" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination are already reversed</h2>
<p>In the meantime, attempts are already being made to medically reverse some of the harmful effects of vaccinations. An expensive but successful procedure for this is the so-called blood washing or apharesis.</p></a>
<a id="I523" spellcheck><h2>Lack of admission limits legal recourse</h2>
<p>Large segments of the world's population have been persuaded or coerced into vaccination, but have limited legal recourse as victims because of emergency licensure. The state typically steps in only after regular licensure.</p></a>
<a id="I524" spellcheck><h2>Use dirty masks is useless</h2>
<p>Wearing the same mask for weeks/months against the specification and kept in your pocket is pointless and dangerous. You constantly inhale fungi, bacteria and harmful, detaching plastic fibers.</p></a>
<a id="I525" spellcheck><h2>Masks make sailor ears</h2>
<p>Wearing masks all the time leads not only to pain in the ears but also gradually to unaesthetically protruding sail ears. One would have to pull back the ears over the same period of time to prevent this.</p></a>
<a id="I526" spellcheck><h2>Professional protective masks only with instructions</h2>
<p>Professional dust masks in particular can only be worn correctly at all after expert instruction and guidance. In everyday life, you can clearly see that this is not done anywhere.</p></a>
<a id="I527" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory disclosure for politicians!</h2>
<p>Before politicians and experts make policy in the Corona context, they would first have to rule out any proximity or dependence on the pharmaceutical industry. This would be the only way to ensure that they also make decisions in the interests of the citizens.</p></a>
<a id="I528" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people start to hate unvaccinated people</h2>
<p>Vaccinated people begin to hate unvaccinated people because of their problems, because of their health, and because of their defensiveness, which now turns out to be correct. Because of these emotions, they are not good decision makers in politics and business.</p></a>
<a id="I529" spellcheck><h2>Origin vaccine ineffective</h2>
<p>Vaccine doses developed against the original alpha variant are still being stored and used. Vaccination with these against the current variants is about as effective as Windows 95 virus protection on a Mac computer.</p></a>
<a id="I530" spellcheck><h2>Global increase in hepatitis</h2>
<p>Increasing numbers of hepatitis cases are occurring worldwide, often necessitating liver transplants or even resulting in death. This is caused by weakened immune systems of the affected persons, for example due to reduced contacts or - the vaccination!</p></a>
<a id="I531" spellcheck><h2>Discreet hearse</h2>
<p>Increasingly, more discreet hearses that are no longer recognizable as such are being used to pick up people who are dying more and more frequently in everyday life. This is done so as not to unsettle people.</p></a>
<a id="I532" spellcheck><h2>Masks make covid worse</h2>
<p>The use of masks has been shown to worsen covid disease by weakening the body and immune system and damaging the lungs, for example, through fungi and germs. Compulsory use of masks is thus even counterproductive.</p></a>
<a id="I533" spellcheck><h2>No compensation for relatives</h2>
<p>As a rule, relatives and survivors of vaccination victims or deaths do not receive any compensation, as there are major bureaucratic hurdles. One of the reasons for this is that no one in the system has an interest in making the cases visible.</p></a>
<a id="I534" spellcheck><h2>Herd immunity only in the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Only unvaccinated persons develop lasting immunity, and thus only they contribute to herd immunity. Vaccinated persons, on the other hand, are permanently dependent on boosters to maintain their immunity.</p></a>
<a id="I535" spellcheck><h2>Only your own immune system counts</h2>
<p>The chances of surviving an infection generally well depend practically only on the condition of one's own immune system. You should therefore invest most of your energy in strengthening it with vitamins and minerals, for example.</p></a>
<a id="I536" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated smell unpleasant</h2>
<p>Inoculated ones can be recognized by partly unpleasant exhalations, which are sweetish and/or remind of evaporating meat. This could indicate that internal decomposition processes have already begun in these.</p></a>
<a id="I537" spellcheck><h2>Media act undemocratically</h2>
<p>Through their one-sided reporting and omissions, the media are not fulfilling their mandate to maintain journalistic balance. In doing so, they undermine the principle of self-regulation - and our democratic system.</p></a>
<a id="I538" spellcheck><h2>Equivalent hijacked plane</h2>
<p>Since vaccination also involves casualties, it is an equivalent of the moral dilemma of wanting to shoot down a hijacked airplane to prevent an attack. Case law has clearly positioned itself against this in the case of the airplane.</p></a>
<a id="I539" spellcheck><h2>No resources for adverse event reporting</h2>
<p>Physicians and hospitals do not have any free resources for reporting vaccination adverse events, and such reporting is of course not remunerated. This is another reason for massive underreporting.</p></a>
<a id="I540" spellcheck><h2>If it goes wrong you have only yourself to blame</h2>
<p>It is particularly perfidious that vaccination victims worldwide are blamed for their own fate by reference to their signature - after people have been driven into vaccination by state-organized regulations and coercion.</p></a>
<a id="I541" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine damage interpreted as long covid</h2>
<p>People who follow the official narrative tend to interpret their own or others' vaccine harms as long covid effects. As a result, they unfortunately also tend to undergo further harmful vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="I542" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous rebreathing with masks</h2>
<p>The prolonged wearing of masks leads to problematic rebreathing of CO2, which is far above occupational health and safety limits and leads to health/cognitive impairments. This is especially true for children!</p></a>
<a id="I543" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated have a Bluetooth identifier</h2>
<p>Inoculated ones seem to send out a Bluetooth identifier that cannot be assigned to a manufacturer as usual. This is not always visible, possibly because the available energy of the injected chips for transmission is limited.</p></a>
<a id="I544" spellcheck><h2>No more trust in institutions</h2>
<p>I no longer have any trust in state structures as a result of the assaults I have experienced by the executive, health authorities and/or state agencies. I will therefore evade the grip of these institutions wherever possible.</p></a>
<a id="I545" spellcheck><h2>Population reduction: China's 2nd attempt</h2>
<p>China is making just another attempt at population reduction with its ruthless covid containment policy that cuts off its citizens from necessities of life - having previously shelved the 1-child policy in a rush for power.</p></a>
<a id="I546" spellcheck><h2>Increase in stillbirths after vaccination</h2>
<p>The number of abortions and stillbirths increased sharply with the start of the vaccination campaign. In the absence of other factors, this correlation is a strong indication of the harmful effect of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I547" spellcheck><h2>Many keep side effects to themselves</h2>
<p>Not everyone who experiences side effects, even if they persist, goes to the doctor with them, whether out of shame or lack of time. Thus, the official figures cannot represent the real extent.</p></a>
<a id="I548" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates' children are not vaccinated</h2>
<p>Bill Gates, contrary to his claims, has generally not had himself or his own children vaccinated, even with the Corona vaccines. This clearly shows that he is very aware of the negative effects of these injections.</p></a>
<a id="I549" spellcheck><h2>Severity independent of vaccination</h2>
<p>The severity of a covid disease is completely independent of whether someone is vaccinated or not. This indicates that the vaccination is ineffective, possibly even that other goals are being pursued with it.</p></a>
<a id="I550" spellcheck><h2>Statistically negative effect of vaccination</h2>
<p>The weak efficacy of the vaccination continues to diminish over time until it statistically slides into the negative after a few months. This suggests that the vaccination has a weakening effect on the immune system.</p></a>
<a id="I551" spellcheck><h2>Medial normalization of side effects</h2>
<p>Typical vaccination side effects such as heart attacks or psoriasis are increasingly described in the media as normal health problems. In principle, other causes are mentioned, e.g. work stress.</p></a>
<a id="I552" spellcheck><h2>High covid rate after vaccination/booster</h2>
<p>Both statistically and empirically, it has long been obvious that covid illnesses increased sharply with the start of the vaccination campaign. In the meantime, hardly any vaccinated person has been spared from covid.</p></a>
<a id="I553" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine and covid damage indistinguishable</h2>
<p>Due to similar symptoms, it is hardly possible to distinguish between vaccination side effects and Long Covid sequelae. This is the intention of those responsible for the continuation of their mass experiment.</p></a>
<a id="I554" spellcheck><h2>Much more sirens and helicopters</h2>
<p>Since the start of the vaccination campaign, we hear many more rescue helicopters and ambulance sirens than before. There can be no other reason for this than that people collapse and also die due to vaccination side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I555" spellcheck><h2>Healthcare infiltrated worldwide</h2>
<p>All over the world, health policy and corresponding institutions at the highest levels are infiltrated with agents of influence who follow a centrally predetermined agenda. This is the only way to explain the decisions that are made in unison.</p></a>
<a id="I556" spellcheck><h2>Safety should be a priority</h2>
<p>Safety of a medical intervention must always take precedence over its effectiveness. This basic medical principle is grossly disregarded in the vaccination campaign, especially by persistently ignoring any warning signals.</p></a>
<a id="I557" spellcheck><h2>Re-infection after infection rare</h2>
<p>Anyone who has once been infected with the virus naturally has a very low probability of being re-infected later. This probability is significantly worse with artificial immunity.</p></a>
<a id="I558" spellcheck><h2>Many can not get infected at all</h2>
<p>A large proportion of the population has long had cross-immunity from other respiratory infections in the past. These are neither at risk of infection nor can they pass on the virus.</p></a>
<a id="I559" spellcheck><h2>Virus mutates only slowly</h2>
<p>The virus mutates only slowly and thus its variants do not carry the risk of undermining existing natural immunity. Thus, natural immunity remains the best strategy against the virus.</p></a>
<a id="I560" spellcheck><h2>Personal measures only protect against bacteria</h2>
<p>Even measures taken, such as wearing a mask or disinfecting hands, can at best protect against bacteria, but not against viruses. Before the crisis, this was still part of the general knowledge of healthcare workers.</p></a>
<a id="I561" spellcheck><h2>Black pedagogy</h2>
<p>Much of the communication on protective measures clearly falls into the realm of 'black pedagogy', especially when children are addressed. The negative psychological consequences cannot even be estimated yet.</p></a>
<a id="I562" spellcheck><h2>The flu shot also has vaccination victims</h2>
<p>It is an open secret that people die in nursing and old people's homes as a result of seasonal flu vaccinations, especially the seriously ill. In this way, 'space is made' for new residents.</p></a>
<a id="I563" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is a Trojan horse</h2>
<p>One can speak of vaccination as a Trojan horse, since it creates the disease from which it claims to protect in the vaccinated in the first place. This is particularly perfidious because symptoms and causes are indistinguishable.</p></a>
<a id="I564" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated much more in the hospital</h2>
<p>Vaccinated persons have to visit hospitals much more frequently than unvaccinated persons due to non-Covid indications. One explanation for this phenomenon is that vaccination itself is responsible for a wide range of different side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I565" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated people are victims of slow poisoning</h2>
<p>With the mRNA vaccines, vaccinated people have unintentionally set in motion processes in their bodies that slowly poison them. Due to this circumstance, many will only experience symptoms of disease after a long period of time.</p></a>
<a id="I566" spellcheck><h2>More people die from hospital germs</h2>
<p>Compared to Covid, many millions more people worldwide die each year from hospital germs, yet little is done about this. This clearly shows that the 'pandemic' is an arbitrarily highlighted problem.</p></a>
<a id="I567" spellcheck><h2>More people die from environmental toxins</h2>
<p>Compared to Covid, many millions more people worldwide die each year from environmental toxins, yet little is done here. This clearly shows that the 'pandemic' is an arbitrarily highlighted problem.</p></a>
<a id="I568" spellcheck><h2>Mild "course of dictatorship</h2>
<p>People experience their state in the Corona period very differently, much like an infection. Those who are loyal to the state simply have a 'milder dictatorship course' than those who are rebellious and can thus maintain their belief in an 'ideal, constitutional world'.</p></a>
<a id="I569" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated victims of shedding</h2>
<p>Many unvaccinated people also contract (long) covid, but this is often due to contact with vaccinated people and so-called shedding, i.e. the transmission of vaccine-related contaminants. This effect distorts the statistics.</p></a>
<a id="I570" spellcheck><h2>Virus patents treacherous</h2>
<p>Both the corona virus DNA and associated vaccines were patented long before the pandemic officially broke out. This impossible timeline should have triggered large-scale criminal investigations long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I571" spellcheck><h2>Many undetectable side effects</h2>
<p>Many side effects of vaccination go undetected for long periods of time, such as heart attacks and cancer. Vaccinated people feel healthy and lull themselves into a false sense of security instead of opting out of the vaccination at an early stage.</p></a>
<a id="I572" spellcheck><h2>Most manipulated disease in history</h2>
<p>The pandemic is one of the most manipulated disease events in history. Never have there been more official lies and unprecedented interference in medical practice by unqualified individuals with enormous wealth, power and influence.</p></a>
<a id="I573" spellcheck><h2>VIPs buy free from vaccination</h2>
<p>All over the world, celebrities and influential people are evading vaccination requirements and obligations by accepting the risk of discovery through purchased certificates. Obviously, they know more than the gullible average citizen.</p></a>
<a id="I574" spellcheck><h2>No mRNA in the vaccines</h2>
<p>Some vaccine samples do not even contain mRNA nanoparticles, instead only undeclared, massively harmful components such as graphene oxide. This recognized deception alone must lead to a ban of the vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="I575" spellcheck><h2>Only what they want to hear</h2>
<p>Responsible people worldwide always insist on listening to scientists and experts. In truth, however, they seem to listen only to those scientists who say what they want to hear.</p></a>
<a id="I576" spellcheck><h2>Crematoria overwhelmed due to specifications</h2>
<p>The crematoria in Bergamo were overwhelmed, not because there were so many bodies, but because the political default was to cremate all the presumed Corona victims. The public was given a false impression here.</p></a>
<a id="I577" spellcheck><h2>Embalmer find huge clots</h2>
<p>Since vaccinations, embalmers have had to remove long, thick, viscous white clots from the bloodstream of corpses, which did not exist in the past. The cause here can only be an immune reaction against mass-produced spike proteins.</p></a>
<a id="I578" spellcheck><h2>Corona app stops protest</h2>
<p>In China, we can see how mandatory Corona warning apps on cell phones are already being misused for population control at demos. This is only a fraction of what will be possible with complete social credit systems.</p></a>
<a id="I579" spellcheck><h2>No heart problems in unvaccinated</h2>
<p>A strong increase in heart problems and heart attacks is not measured in the unvaccinated but only in the vaccinated. These problems are also officially stated by the manufacturers as vaccination side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I580" spellcheck><h2>Where there is a risk there must be choice</h2>
<p>Mandatory vaccination violates the principle that where there is a risk, there must also be a choice. And the risks of vaccines are documented millions of times in side effect databases worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I581" spellcheck><h2>New approval without further studies</h2>
<p>Vaccines adapted to new corona variants are now being approved worldwide without any requirement for further studies. This is particularly fatal because the original vaccines were also approved on the basis of the thinnest of studies.</p></a>
<a id="I582" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory child vaccination without sufficient testing</h2>
<p>Health authorities worldwide enact vaccination obligations for children without considering the risk profile or the study situation. Here only deliberate, criminal influence on the decision-makers can be assumed.</p></a>
<a id="I583" spellcheck><h2>Taboo prevents politician resignations</h2>
<p>The now normal taboo on criticism of bad decisions and corruption in the Corona context gives politicians a kind of political immunity - which is already evident in the lack of resignations after misconduct.</p></a>
<a id="I584" spellcheck><h2>Mask is alu hat of Corona sect</h2>
<p>The Corona fear in the majority of the population has led to a sectarian belief in authoritarian and scientifically unsubstantiated measures. The masks are in no way inferior to the proverbial Aluhut of the conspiracy theorists.</p></a>
<a id="I585" spellcheck><h2>Crosses the blood-brain barrier</h2>
<p>Corona vaccines are the first to be shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and also to exert their damaging effects, for example by forming clots in the brain. This is not a mistake, but a result of the technology.</p></a>
<a id="I586" spellcheck><h2>Fact checker unqualified</h2>
<p>A large part of the people who work for the countless fact checker portals are demonstrably not qualified for this work. Which also explains their often selective and unscientific actions and arguments.</p></a>
<a id="I587" spellcheck><h2>Effectiveness of vaccination questionable</h2>
<p>If I were still getting sick even after three or four vaccinations, I would slowly start asking critical questions about the effectiveness and duration of action of the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I588" spellcheck><h2>Uniformed consent</h2>
<p>With the knowledge of the real risks and the low/short protective effect, hardly anyone would have voluntarily opted for vaccination. Thus, one can rightly speak of an - unlawful - uninformed consent.</p></a>
<a id="I589" spellcheck><h2>Third party protection through vaccination contradictory</h2>
<p>The assumption that one can protect others by one's own vaccination is simply absurd. If you can still spread the disease, you can't lull anyone into a sense of security with this premise.</p></a>
<a id="I590" spellcheck><h2>Pandemics from 2020 to 2030</h2>
<p>According to official plans of the WHO, the issue of pandemics is to be the focus of attention for 10 years, i.e. until 2030. This planning alone shows that this is not a natural but an artificial problem.</p></a>
<a id="I591" spellcheck><h2>Tedro's human rights violator</h2>
<p>WHO chief Tedros was previously a senior member of the terrorist organization Tigre and is said to have covered up three major cholera epidemics as Ethiopia's health minister. There was great opposition to his appointment as head of the WHO.</p></a>
<a id="I592" spellcheck><h2>Users are flooded with information</h2>
<p>One strategy for suppressing unwanted information is simply to flood the recipients with information. The aim is to ensure that the recipients never have a moment's peace to deal with critical issues.</p></a>
<a id="I593" spellcheck><h2>Drugs for side effects become scarce</h2>
<p>Worldwide, a shortage of thrombosis, heart attack and stroke drugs is becoming apparent due to increased demand. This is another clear indication of a large number of severe side effects of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I594" spellcheck><h2>Fortunately no twins</h2>
<p>Getting sick despite vaccinations and thinking you were lucky to have been vaccinated is about the same as getting pregnant despite contraception and thinking you were lucky to have used contraception because at least you didn't have twins.</p></a>
<a id="I595" spellcheck><h2>Mask on beard is useless</h2>
<p>Wearing a mask over a beard is completely pointless, because far too much side air is drawn here. People who do this and at the same time ask others to wear a mask can no longer be taken seriously.</p></a>
<a id="I596" spellcheck><h2>Each vaccination costs additional years of life</h2>
<p>Each additional so-called 'booster' further reduces the lifespan of vaccinated individuals as more and more toxic components circulate in the body. There is only one way to avoid further damage: Stop immediately!</p></a>
<a id="I597" spellcheck><h2>Pavloxide most toxic drug ever</h2>
<p>Pavloxide, which is marketed as a drug against corona, is the most toxic drug ever. Its uncritical use by physicians worldwide is reminiscent of the AIDS era, in which AZT occupied this inglorious position.</p></a>
<a id="I598" spellcheck><h2>Omikron just a name</h2>
<p>The virus has long had a wide variety of variants, all of which are now called Omikron. This is just another name that makes the 'enemy' tangible and boosts sales of the next vaccine update.</p></a>
<a id="I599" spellcheck><h2>mRNA in breast milk!</h2>
<p>mRNA has now also been detected in the breast milk of vaccinated individuals. Through breastfeeding, it is passed on to the mother's own children and can harm them, for example through heart inflammation or nerve diseases.</p></a>
<a id="I600" spellcheck><h2>Masks and vaccination should be voluntary</h2>
<p>With the low risks associated with covid disease for healthy, non-pre-existing individuals, mandatory measures are no longer explicable. The only correct way is that of voluntary mask and vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I601" spellcheck><h2>Most severe side effects with pre-existing conditions</h2>
<p>People with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, or obesity experience more frequent and severe side effects after vaccination. These cannot be defined away as 'long covid'.</p></a>
<a id="I602" spellcheck><h2>Allergies after vaccination</h2>
<p>Allergies and food intolerances after vaccination become a new or worsening problem for many people. The manufacturers also knew about this side effect long before the start of the vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="I603" spellcheck><h2>Individual benefit-risk ratio</h2>
<p>Medical treatments have always had to take into account an individual risk-benefit ratio in addition to the general one. It is irresponsible that this is simply omitted in the case of the new type of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I604" spellcheck><h2>Public prosecutor investigates EU</h2>
<p>The EU Commission headed by Ursula von der Leyen is being targeted by the EU Public Prosecutor's Office due to irregularities in the procurement of vaccines. The technocrats in the EU apparently think they can get away with any kind of cronyism.</p></a>
<a id="I605" spellcheck><h2>Fake syringe for conspirators</h2>
<p>Initiated conspirators have been publicly inoculating themselves with a fake syringe in which the needle recedes and the liquid disappears into the slide.  This can be purchased at any trick store.</p></a>
<a id="I606" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated deserve redress</h2>
<p>The unvaccinated suffered many personal deprivations during the height of the public hounding of them that were not medically justified. They deserve public relief and redress.</p></a>
<a id="I607" spellcheck><h2>Hatred of the unvaccinated planned in advance</h2>
<p>Yale University conceived the international smear campaign against vaccinators long before vaccines were even available. This is another indication that this is a contrived crisis.</p></a>
<a id="I608" spellcheck><h2>More and more young people die</h2>
<p>Evidence shows that more and more young people are dying unexpectedly from vaccine side effects, especially cardiovascular problems. The causes of the persistent excess mortality of younger people should have been investigated more closely long ago.</p></a>
<a id="I609" spellcheck><h2>Pfizer blackmails governments worldwide</h2>
<p>Pfizer blocks vaccine donations, unilaterally changes delivery dates, demands public assets as collateral - and the secrecy of its contracts with buyer countries. This behavior looks more like a mafia organization.</p></a>
<a id="I610" spellcheck><h2>Side effect reports not compensated</h2>
<p>The fact that doctors around the world are compensated for vaccinations but not for side effect reports already shows how much interest there is in public health. Doctors are simply steered economically in the desired direction.</p></a>
<a id="I611" spellcheck><h2>Quarantine is useless</h2>
<p>In a quarantine study, the control group went on to work causing even fewer infections. This illustrates how completely unsuitable this measure is, which entails so much negative collateral damage.</p></a>
<a id="I612" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinations increase the risk of covid</h2>
<p>mRNA vaccinations increase not only the risk of covid infection after a manageable time, but also the risk of hospitalization and death! Vaccinated people now probably have no choice but to continue vaccinating regularly.</p></a>
<a id="I613" spellcheck><h2>Mask is now pure respect gesture</h2>
<p>The mask has now become a gesture of respect, whether in a restaurant, museum or on a state visit. Whether it's a rule or a good idea, it's being worn in more and more places around the world simply as a well-intentioned gesture - and it's being forced on employees.</p></a>
<a id="I614" spellcheck><h2>China builds quarantine camp</h2>
<p>China, in its NoCovid mania, continues to build inhumane 'quarantine camps' at a rapid pace throughout the country. These camps permanently serve the government as tools of oppression for its own population.</p></a>
<a id="I615" spellcheck><h2>Gigantic corruption scandal in the EU</h2>
<p>The purchase of 4.5 billion doses of Covid vaccine for 450 million inhabitants of the EU is one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of mankind. And this purchase was not even within the competence of the Commission.</p></a>
<a id="I616" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination exacerbates Parkinson's</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease can worsen after vaccination because the vaccines enter the brain and insert the genetic code for the harmful spike protein there.</p></a>
<a id="I617" spellcheck><h2>Covid long since endemic</h2>
<p>Covid has long been an endemic disease due to its treatability and low infectious mortality, and could be treated as such. However, powerful interest groups have other plans and will not allow this.</p></a>
<a id="I618" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine not tested for transmission</h2>
<p>In the approval studies of the manufacturers it was never examined whether the vaccines suppress a further transmission of the virus. All corresponding statements of politics and industry must be classified as dangerous misinformation!</p></a>
<a id="I619" spellcheck><h2>French policy not vaccinated</h2>
<p>According to a well-known French politician and vaccination victim, most French politicians are not vaccinated, but at the same time have imposed this measure on their own citizens with drastic pressure.</p></a>
<a id="I620" spellcheck><h2>Fatigue of the immune system due to vaccination</h2>
<p>In Israel, it has been shown that too many booster vaccinations can lead to 'immune system fatigue'. There, a relevant number of people have already had their fourth vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I621" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic Preparedness dangerous ideology</h2>
<p>Pandemic Preparedness is a human life endangering ideology, funded with billions by Big Pharma, military and intelligence agencies. A global moratorium must be imposed on gain-of-function research as its basis.</p></a>
<a id="I622" spellcheck><h2>Pharmaceutical colonialism</h2>
<p>Activities of the pharmaceutical mafia and its large foundations in Africa strongly resemble colonialism, but are even worse, because the colonial powers at least left helpful infrastructure in the colonies.</p></a>
<a id="I623" spellcheck><h2>Hydroxychloroquine suppressed</h2>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine had widespread use without prescription in many malaria-stricken countries as 'Sunday Sunday', but malicious tampering massively limited its availability - costing countless victims.</p></a>
<a id="I624" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination opposition as terrorism</h2>
<p>In many countries, legal foundations are being laid to classify opposition to vaccination as a form of terrorism. These interventions are fully in the interest of those who want to turn the world around in this way.</p></a>
<a id="I625" spellcheck><h2>General Blanchons Superhelden</h2>
<p>French General Blanchon published an ode to the unvaccinated, praising their strong character, great courage and critical thinking. And calls them the embodiment of the best of humanity.</p></a>
<a id="I626" spellcheck><h2>DNA of the virus very unlikely</h2>
<p>The DNA of the virus is so unlikely in its composition that it points to artificial creation in the laboratory. It would not be the first time that modified pathogens were brought into the world under evil intentions.</p></a>
<a id="I627" spellcheck><h2>Masks make sick people sicker</h2>
<p>People who have a respiratory condition make it worse by wearing a mask because they keep inhaling the pests. People's ignorance is exploited to deliberately perpetuate a condition.</p></a>
<a id="I628" spellcheck><h2>New 80% deadly covid strain</h2>
<p>An 80% lethal covid hybrid variant has been created in a Boston laboratory. This process is an irresponsible play with fire that could trigger the next laboratory-generated pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="I629" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic and Burner Phones</h2>
<p>Some conspirators in the pandemic deception covered their communication tracks with the help of so-called 'burner phones'. This alone is indication enough that those involved did not have the public welfare in mind.</p></a>
<a id="I630" spellcheck><h2>Mandatory vaccination of children in the USA!</h2>
<p>With the Covid vaccination now enforced as a regular childhood vaccination in the USA, the vaccine manufacturers enjoy complete immunity. Critical parents there can no longer send their children to a regular school.</p></a>
<a id="I631" spellcheck><h2>Media competence can save lives</h2>
<p>Millions of vaccination victims misguided by the media show that media competence and critical thinking can also save lives. In the meantime, no meaningful assessment of reality is possible without alternative media and critical literature.</p></a>
<a id="I632" spellcheck><h2>Listen to Holocaust survivors</h2>
<p>Even many Holocaust survivors confirm that the worldwide Corona technocracy is comparable to conditions at that time. And that especially the aspect of forced medicine is clearly reminiscent of National Socialism.</p></a>
<a id="I633" spellcheck><h2>Not safe from punishment</h2>
<p>Many followers of the corona technocracy, who bring misfortune to other people through their actions, will not hide from punishment in the future. Karma will balance everything out again in the end.</p></a>
<a id="I634" spellcheck><h2>Like the frog in boiling water</h2>
<p>The totalitarian structures that are slowly building up around the world are invisible to people because they are being erected in many small steps. It's like the parable of the frog in the slowly boiling water.</p></a>
<a id="I635" spellcheck><h2>Chlorine dioxide solution helps</h2>
<p>Chlorine dioxide solution, as an alternative method of treatment, gives sufferers a kind of magic bullet with which they can effectively treat not only respiratory diseases. Information about these methods has long been suppressed.</p></a>
<a id="I636" spellcheck><h2>Hallucinations before the overturn</h2>
<p>Some vaccinated people (and animals) who have been filmed collapsing seem to have halucinations just before. This can be explained by problems with the oxygen supply to the brain.</p></a>
<a id="I637" spellcheck><h2>Twitter Files</h2>
<p>The "Twitter Files" published by Twitter after the Musk takeover show massive censorship - also and especially of established doctors and scientists on the Corona issue. Here, basic principles were turned upside down.</p></a>
<a id="I638" spellcheck><h2>Freeze blood to preserve evidence</h2>
<p>Anyone wishing to claim damages in connection with their vaccination should freeze blood samples, preferably from before and after vaccination. In this way, causal relationships can still be proven later.</p></a>
<a id="I639" spellcheck><h2>Sickness rate in schools &amp; daycare centers irresponsible</h2>
<p>Since the start of vaccinations, sickness rates have also been at an all-time high in daycare centers and schools. The reason is a mixture of fear of children as carriers and vaccine damage. This leads to an irresponsible care situation.</p></a>
<a id="I640" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic Treaty</h2>
<p>The Pandemic Treaty that WHO is in the process of entering into with almost all countries worldwide gives it the power to force pandemic response rules and measures to them and their citizens over and above national laws.</p></a>
<a id="I641" spellcheck><h2>Catastrophic Contagion</h2>
<p>The latest international pandemic exercise, Catastrophic Contagion, was again about a global virus pandemic. If things go as they did with Event 201, we will probably soon be facing the next staged pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="I642" spellcheck><h2>Measures isolate disabled</h2>
<p>The fate of disabled people was among the dire collateral damage of global pandemic containment efforts. They were deprived of their support, isolated and forced into the harmful vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="I643" spellcheck><h2>Hypertension</h2>
<p>High blood pressure is a typical symptom of vaccinated individuals. Among other things, the heart of those affected has to work against blood vessels "clogged" by clots, which occur due to immune reactions against spike proteins and by foreign bodies.</p></a>
<a id="I644" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine only with disclaimer</h2>
<p>In extortionate negotiations, the manufacturers sold their vaccines only to countries that contractually assured them of a disclaimer. The welfare of the people played no role in this.</p></a>
<a id="I645" spellcheck><h2>Why secret contracts?</h2>
<p>Why did vaccine manufacturers worldwide insist on keeping contracts secret? Leaked documents show disclaimers, high prices, and long-term purchase commitments. Why, if the vaccines are so effective?</p></a>
<a id="I646" spellcheck><h2>Fortunately there are idiots</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are idiots and conspiracy theorists who question, open their mouths and fight back - if everyone just followed the herd, it would lead to disaster, as it has many times in history.</p></a>
<a id="I647" spellcheck><h2>Measures are voodoo</h2>
<p>All measures prescribed worldwide, such as lockdowns, masks or discrimination against the unvaccinated, lack robust scientific evidence of effectiveness beyond model calculations. In other words, they are pure voodoo.</p></a>
<a id="I648" spellcheck><h2>Physicians and nurses often vaccination victims</h2>
<p>Since the start of the global vaccination campaign, many vaccination victims have also appeared in the healthcare sector. The pressure to undergo continued vaccinations is particularly high here. There is a threat of job loss due to legal obligations.</p></a>
<a id="I649" spellcheck><h2>Ideology of safe vaccines</h2>
<p>That the Corona vaccines are safe and effective has become a real ideology, contrary to reality. It provides a denial and reinterpretation of the vaccination victims and side effects by large sections of the population.</p></a>
<a id="I650" spellcheck><h2>More and more disabled</h2>
<p>Since the start of vaccination, the number of disabled people has been statistically increasing. This can be explained, among other things, by the many non-fatal side effects, such as paralysis, amputations after thromboses or neurological problems.</p></a>
<a id="I651" spellcheck><h2>Resistance is quietly extinguished</h2>
<p>Unnoticed by the majority of the population, prominent Corona dissidents are being legally attacked worldwide without media attention and deprived of their livelihoods. In this way, developing resistance is effectively extinguished.</p></a>
<a id="I652" spellcheck><h2>Kary Mullis gone before pandemic starts</h2>
<p>Shortly before the start of the Covid pandemic, Dr. Kary Mullis, inventor of the PCR test, died suddenly. He was in the way, because his refusal to use PCR tests for diagnostic purposes would have disrupted the Corona narrative!</p></a>
<a id="I653" spellcheck><h2>Plastic fibers in the lungs</h2>
<p>Plastic masks used to protect against infection have the negative effect that as the mask ages, more and more micro-fibers detach from it during breathing and collect as foreign bodies in the lungs.</p></a>
<a id="I654" spellcheck><h2>Educational television</h2>
<p>Around the world, state and private television stations have not only uncritically replicated the Corona narrative, but have also practiced completely one-sided "education" of the population in supposedly correct behavior.</p></a>
<a id="I655" spellcheck><h2>Social distancing prevents exchange</h2>
<p>Social distancing and speech bans, e.g. in means of transport, have the effect of preventing people from exchanging ideas and thus resisting. They are a perfidious means of isolating people through rules and making them compliant.</p></a>
<a id="I656" spellcheck><h2>Statistical warning signals ignored</h2>
<p>Institutions around the world that were required to collect and evaluate statistical warning signals from clinical feedback for new drugs/vaccines have failed to do their job, whether due to negligence or pressure/corruption!</p></a>
<a id="I657" spellcheck><h2>Peer pressure</h2>
<p>During the campaigns to combat the pandemic, the principle of peer pressure was used very successfully, especially among young people, whether it was masks or vaccinationm because no one wants to put themselves on the sidelines.</p></a>
<a id="I658" spellcheck><h2>One-sided public discussions</h2>
<p>All over the world, public debates, for example on talk shows, were deliberately one-sided with protagonists for the narrative. The sham discussions conducted in this way left the viewer with the false impression of a balanced discourse.</p></a>
<a id="I659" spellcheck><h2>Hygiene and self-isolation only</h2>
<p>The only non-medical measures that have always been known to work against the spread of viruses are hygiene and self-isolation. All others have no scientific basis.</p></a>
<a id="I660" spellcheck><h2>Fear of deviating from the majority opinion</h2>
<p>The fear of many to deviate from the majority opinion is well founded. Deviants who are too visible are made examples of, often with loss of status, reputation and livelihood.</p></a>
<a id="I661" spellcheck><h2>Long Covid without previous Corona</h2>
<p>Many patients who receive a long covid diagnosis had no prior corona disease at all to which it could be attributed. But just about all of them received multiple corona vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="I662" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination already banned elsewhere</h2>
<p>Vaccination has already been partially banned in some countries due to safety concerns. How can it be that it just continues in other countries and these findings do not lead to a reassessment there as well?</p></a>
<a id="I663" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of lies</h2>
<p>The only thing that has reached pandemic dimensions in recent years is lies. They have become the only permissible truth via hundreds of fact checkers, campaigns worth millions and effective social engineering.</p></a>
<a id="I664" spellcheck><h2>Narrative is like religion</h2>
<p>The official Corona narrative of dangerous virus, effective vaccination and effective measures now has the character of religion through repetition. The majority of people no longer allow themselves to deviate from the doctrine of salvation.</p></a>
<a id="I665" spellcheck><h2>Brain most washed body part</h2>
<p>Asked about the most washed body part during the pandemic, most think of the hands. In truth, however, it was the brain. In the form of an unprecedented media propaganda campaign.</p></a>
<a id="I666" spellcheck><h2>Just shoot em' right into the vein!</h2>
<p>Bill Gates' diabolical subconscious is making its way: 'We're taking things that are genetically modified organisms and injecting them into the arms of little children - just shooting them into the vein.'</p></a>
<a id="I667" spellcheck><h2>The next one will get attention!</h2>
<p>Bill and Melina Gates stated in an interview with a knowing smile about the Pandemic: 'We have to prepare for the next one, that will get attention this time!'. Which sounds more like a threat than like a prediction.</p></a>
<a id="I668" spellcheck><h2>No Covid ist absurd</h2>
<p>The so-called no covid strategy is an intellectual imposition. The attempt to eradicate a respiratory virus by non-medical measures is directly doomed to failure - not to mention the suffering caused by the measures.</p></a>
<a id="I669" spellcheck><h2>Everyone now knows vaccination victims</h2>
<p>Everyone now knows people in their environment who have died or suffered vaccine damage after vaccination. This shows that the side effect rate of vaccination must be significantly higher than officially stated.</p></a>
<a id="I670" spellcheck><h2>Governments "penetrated" worldwide</h2>
<p>Klaus Schwab has stated that governments worldwide are riddled with his Young Global Leaders graduates. One must assume that these politicians do not make independent decisions for the good of their people.</p></a>
<a id="I671" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated and HIV positive</h2>
<p>Those who are vaccinated have a high probability of testing positive for HIV. This effect probably comes from the fact that the spike protein DNA contains fragments of HIV. Which in turn is an indication of its laboratory origin.</p></a>
<a id="I672" spellcheck><h2>Foegen effect for masks</h2>
<p>According to the Foegen effect, the use of masks can aggravate infections. This is caused by deep re-inhalation of condensed droplets or viruses previously trapped in the filters of the mask.</p></a>
<a id="I673" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is sacrosanct</h2>
<p>Vaccination became untouchable by media and political mantras. The successfully manipulated subconscious of doctors, politicians and officials blocks the view of the reality of the now obvious harmfulness.</p></a>
<a id="I674" spellcheck><h2>Immunity only on the mucosa</h2>
<p>The immunity that the vaccines are designed to produce in the body would be needed more on the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract to effectively prevent viruses from entering the body. The antibodies produced are otherwise not very effective.</p></a>
<a id="I675" spellcheck><h2>Limited antibodies in vaccination</h2>
<p>The antibodies produced by vaccination have limited effectiveness because they act only against the spike protein, whereas in natural immunization with the real virus, the body develops antibodies against all virus components.</p></a>
<a id="I676" spellcheck><h2>Antibodies are radical</h2>
<p>The antibodies formed in large quantities in the body as a result of vaccination have a very radical effect and also attack tissue that produces spike proteins. This explains organ damage in vaccinated individuals.</p></a>
<a id="I677" spellcheck><h2>Neutral reporting on China</h2>
<p>Since people in China have been rebelling against measures, the mass media can suddenly report neutrally about opponents of measures. This clearly shows that double standards are being applied here - and such media are not to be trusted.</p></a>
<a id="I678" spellcheck><h2>For China, mRNA is a bioweapon</h2>
<p>The Chinese government has called mRNA vaccine technology a bioweapon in official pronouncements. Statistically, they are in any case more harmful than all other vaccines developed worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="I679" spellcheck><h2>Will not forgive</h2>
<p>The people who have questioned the Corona narrative and, if necessary, renounced vaccination, will not simply forgive the defamations and exclusions. They will press for full clarification and prosecution of the perpetrators.</p></a>
<a id="I680" spellcheck><h2>In hospitals a lot of time for dancing</h2>
<p>In hospitals around the world, staff had plenty of time due to low demand during the pandemic - and used it, among other things, to rehearse elaborate dance choreographies, such as to "Jerusalema".</p></a>
<a id="I681" spellcheck><h2>Enemy image is established</h2>
<p>The enemy image of irresponsible Corona opponents that was established in the media at the beginning of the crisis has taken root in the minds of the majority - and is not changing even when they are proven right on more and more points.</p></a>
<a id="I682" spellcheck><h2>No viable politicians</h2>
<p>Politicians are less qualified because their poor pay is too little for good managers - and therefore only failures and shirkers are attracted. They are more dependent and can thus be easily manipulated from the outside.</p></a>
<a id="I683" spellcheck><h2>Statistical warning signals ignored</h2>
<p>The diagnosis data of the health insurance companies show massive increases in sudden deaths and many diseases since the beginning of vaccinations. Unfortunately, these statistical safety signals are criminally disregarded.</p></a>
<a id="I684" spellcheck><h2>Medication scarce</h2>
<p>Because of the many side effects and weakened immune systems after vaccination, drugs are now in short supply. This is particularly evident in the treatment of children. Another boon for the pharmaceutical industry.</p></a>
<a id="I685" spellcheck><h2>Just keep vaccinating</h2>
<p>Doctors recommend further Corona vaccinations to their patients even after serious side effects. The mantra of safe vaccination without side effects is stronger than the professional ethics and sense of responsibility of physicians.</p></a>
<a id="I686" spellcheck><h2>Intensive care beds are always occupied</h2>
<p>With its incentive structures, the public healthcare system automatically ensures that hospital operators occupy/utilize their intensive care beds with patients. This circumstance makes statistics on this less meaningful.</p></a>
<a id="I687" spellcheck><h2>Aspiration mandatory in Sweden</h2>
<p>Aspiration, ensuring that the vaccine does not enter the bloodstream directly, has been mandatory in Sweden for Corona vaccination. This could explain why there are fewer vaccination victims there than in the rest of the world.</p></a>
<a id="I688" spellcheck><h2>Narrowed debate space</h2>
<p>Public debate on important issues such as the harmfulness of vaccines, the treatment of vaccine victims, or corruption in vaccine procurement is suppressed until it is no longer possible - and thus remains ineffective.</p></a>
<a id="I689" spellcheck><h2>Child vaccination deliberately overdosed</h2>
<p>Children have also been given the adult dose of vaccines and thus overdosed, mainly to simplify procedures. Here, children were exposed to unnecessary risks, which are now manifested in side effects.</p></a>
<a id="I690" spellcheck><h2>With swine flu already two vaccines</h2>
<p>Already during the swine flu pandemic, there was evidence of other vaccines for politicians and officials. In the case of the Corona pandemic, too, it must be assumed that insiders evaded normal vaccination in whole or in part.</p></a>
<a id="I691" spellcheck><h2>No antibodies after vaccination</h2>
<p>In many people, antibody tests after vaccination indicate that it has had no effect in terms of training their immune defenses against the coronavirus. So the feeling of security from the vaccination is not appropriate.</p></a>
<a id="I692" spellcheck><h2>Majority does not want world government</h2>  
<p>The majority of people are opposed to globalism, the WEF and its centralist agenda, and see in it a root of coming evil. This vote cannot simply be ignored.</p></a>
