<h1>The<i> Sheeple</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="S1" spellcheck><h2>What about Bergamo?</h2>
<p>In Bergamo, the hospitals were completely overloaded in March and this can happen again at any time and also in our country! Therefore, the measures to contain the pandemic are without alternative.</p></a>
<a id="S2" spellcheck><h2>What about New York?</h2>
<p>In New York, the hospitals were completely overloaded in April and this can happen again at any time and also in our country! Therefore, the measures to contain the pandemic are without alternative.</p></a>
<a id="S3" spellcheck><h2>Flatten the Curve!</h2>
<p>When infection rates rise, we need these measures to flatten the curve again. Otherwise, our healthcare system will inevitably become overburdened, to the detriment of all!</p></a>
<a id="S4" spellcheck><h2>Prevent triage</h2>
<p>When the healthcare system is overloaded, staff are forced to prioritize patients over others as part of a triage process if they can no longer treat everyone. This must be prevented at all costs!</p></a>
<a id="S5" spellcheck><h2>Coffins stacking</h2>
<p>Everywhere where the virus has really broken out, the coffins have piled up at the hospitals. The military had to help with the removal - the whole thing is not to be trifled with!</p></a>
<a id="S6" spellcheck><h2>Exponential!</h2>
<p>As soon as the curve of infected persons starts to increase exponentially, one must assume a continuation in exponential form. Therefore, drastic containment measures are justified!</p></a>
<a id="S7" spellcheck><h2>It's only a mask</h2>
<p>Wearing a mask according to the specifications is a negligible sacrifice for the protection of all. The criticism of this is not to be understood at all.</p></a>
<a id="S8" spellcheck><h2>Aerosols</h2>
<p>The virus is transmitted via aerosols, e.g. through breathing, speaking and singing, even if the person concerned does not have visible symptoms. Wearing masks helps to reduce the spread of aerosols.</p></a>
<a id="S9" spellcheck><h2>Even the young die</h2>
<p>Even young people are affected by severe courses or even death from the virus. Therefore, we cannot rely on not belonging to the risk group.</p></a>
<a id="S10" spellcheck><h2>Nature strikes back</h2>
<p>We as humans have brought the crisis on ourselves, since we have thoughtlessly destroyed nature and thus our own habitat in the past. Now nature has struck back.</p></a>
<a id="S11" spellcheck><h2>Corona Parties</h2>
<p>When people party, dance and relax together, it contributes to the dangerous spread of the virus. Therefore, we will have to do without it in the future.</p></a>
<a id="S12" spellcheck><h2>Our planet recovers</h2>
<p>Lockdowns are good for the planet. Air and water pollution decreases when there is hardly any more tourism, cruises and flying. That's why it would be nice if this just continued permanently now.</p></a>
<a id="S13" spellcheck><h2>Long-term consequences</h2>
<p>It is not possible to say anything about the long-term consequences of the new viral disease after such a short time. And therefore it is justified that people continue to be as careful as possible and comply with the prescribed measures.</p></a>
<a id="S14" spellcheck><h2>We still know so little</h2>
<p>Because we still know too little about the virus, it is justified to demand austerity from people for the time being. Once the virus has been sufficiently studied and found to pose little risk, life can be ramped up again.</p></a>
<a id="S15" spellcheck><h2>Politicians play it safe</h2>
<p>Politicians have no choice but to impose the strictest possible measures, because they have to take the safest possible route. It is a matter of the common good, to which the individual must subordinate himself.</p></a>
<a id="S16" spellcheck><h2>Fact checker says...</h2>
<p>All the critics' objections and arguments have already been refuted by the many fact checkers on the web. You can rely on the science journalists behind these checks.</p></a>
<a id="S17" spellcheck><h2>Can think for myself</h2>
<p>I don't need to read the alternative media from which the critics get their information and assessments. I can think for myself and don't need these voices to do so.</p></a>
<a id="S18" spellcheck><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2>
<p>Any indications that motives other than the health of all of us might be at play in the crisis are all wild conspiracy theories and are not worth investigating further.</p></a>
<a id="S19" spellcheck><h2>Sweden death rate</h2>
<p>Due to the higher death rate, the 'Swedish way', i.e. the renunciation of lockdowns and emergency regulations, is out of the question for the rest of the world. Those who demand this only want to accept more victims.</p></a>
<a id="S20" spellcheck><h2>Trump position</h2>
<p>Donald Trump as a US presidential joke gives critical and aberrant views on the virus and the measures that should not be adopted. With the same views as Trump is always on the wrong side!</p></a>
<a id="S21" spellcheck><h2>Immunity does not last</h2>
<p>Antibodies against the corona virus could no longer be detected in infected persons after a short time! Therefore, one must assume that a herd immunity will not occur naturally.</p></a>
<a id="S22" spellcheck><h2>Not a virologist</h2>
<p>Virologists are the ones most likely to be able to assess all aspects, including social, epidemiological and medical, of the current virus crisis and the measures prescribed. That is why it is best to listen to them.</p></a>
<a id="S23" spellcheck><h2>Protect others</h2>
<p>The only viable way to deal with the current virus crisis is for us healthy people to protect the vulnerable and susceptible. Self-protection of these groups is out of the question or not sufficient.</p></a>
<a id="S24" spellcheck><h2>Listen to experts</h2>
<p>The experts currently heard almost everywhere in the world advocating lockdowns and emergency regulations are the only experts to listen to. Other views are exceptions and should not matter.</p></a>
<a id="S25" spellcheck><h2>Need vaccine first</h2>
<p>We can only return to normality when we have a functioning vaccination, as with the flu. Everything else is an irresponsible endangerment of human lives!</p></a>
<a id="S26" spellcheck><h2>Real Risk group</h2>
<p>If you yourself and/or your friends or relatives belong to the risk group, you are understandably worried. Therefore, one is naturally no longer so open to arguments against measures.</p></a>
<a id="S27" spellcheck><h2>Puts everyone in danger</h2>
<p>People who oppose the currently suspended democratic rules, the lockdowns and emergency decrees, e.g. by demonstrating, are putting everyone else in danger. One should take away them this right best also still.</p></a>
<a id="S28" spellcheck><h2>Neoliberalism at it's end</h2>
<p>The crisis will ensure that the harmful neoliberalism will come to an end and will be replaced by a peaceful, resource-saving and humane form of economy. The hardships will be worth it for everyone!</p></a>
<a id="S29" spellcheck><h2>Children very contagious</h2>
<p>Children in particular are very contagious and therefore the spread of the virus among them must be prevented. Strong hygiene measures in schools and daycare centers and closures are justified for this purpose.</p></a>
<a id="S30" spellcheck><h2>Avoiding all Contact</h2>
<p>Contact avoidance is the only truly reliable way to stop the spread of the virus. We all just need to keep it up for a while.</p></a>
<a id="S31" spellcheck><h2>Charlatans</h2>
<p>How can we be sure that the doctors and scientists who oppose the broad consensus on measures like lockdowns aren't simply charlatans?</p></a>
<a id="S32" spellcheck><h2>Critics a Minority</h2>
<p>Critics of the current course are in the minority. In a democracy, it cannot be that this minority can impose its will on the majority, or try to do so!</p></a>
<a id="S33" spellcheck><h2>Fake News</h2>
<p>Information that contradicts the official Corona line is usually quickly exposed as fake news. Those who fall for it are simply too uncritical in their use of information.</p></a>
<a id="S34" spellcheck><h2>Hard cases</h2>
<p>Cases reported in the media of severe respiratory diseases caused by this virus prove its danger and the increased risk. There is no need to look at any statistics.</p></a>
<a id="S35" spellcheck><h2>John Snow Memorandum</h2>
<p>According to the John Snow memorandum, covid mortality (IFR) is much higher than influenza, there are long-lasting symptoms, and it is unclear how long immunity will last. Therefore, the measures are appropriate and reasonable.</p></a>
<a id="S36" spellcheck><h2>Numbers low THANKS to Lockdown</h2>
<p>The infection figures have fallen again because the lockdown was so successful. It has proven to be an effective tool for containing the pandemic after all.</p></a>
<a id="S37" spellcheck><h2>What would you do?</h2>
<p>What would you do yourself if you were in the place of the politicians responsible? Confronted with defenseless victims in old people's homes and intensive care units, as well as with irresponsible partygoers?</p></a>
<a id="S38" spellcheck><h2>What freedoms?</h2>
<p>I do not understand, which liberties the critics miss then so! They can be happy to still be allowed to demonstrate, although they do not even adhere to their conditions!</p></a>
<a id="S39" spellcheck><h2>What basic rights?</h2>
<p>The lost fundamental rights are in reality only privileges that the rest of the world does not have. The temporary renunciation of them out of solidarity is for a good cause!</p></a>
<a id="S40" spellcheck><h2>Scientific consensus</h2>
<p>What is decided worldwide in terms of measures and restrictions for people has been weighed up by experts. It is supported and endorsed by the majority of scientists in the relevant fields.</p></a>
<a id="S41" spellcheck><h2>Intensive beds full</h2>
<p>If we do not strictly adhere to the guidelines from above and practice restraint, the intensive care beds will fill up faster than we would like. Then the measures will have to be really tightened up, which nobody wants!</p></a>
<a id="S42" spellcheck><h2>Swedish approach failed</h2>
<p>The 'Swedish way' of dealing with the crisis, to forego mandatory measures, has failed. The 'rowing back' shows that the rest of the world was right!</p></a>
<a id="S43" spellcheck><h2>Not comparable</h2>
<p>The current crisis is not statistically comparable with flu situations of the past, because this time the majority behaved very cautiously! This caution has massively pushed the numbers down.</p></a>
<a id="S44" spellcheck><h2>Population density</h2>
<p>The experiences like in Sweden will not help us, because it is a hardly inhabited area country. The rest of Europe, especially big cities, can't copy anything here!</p></a>
<a id="S45" spellcheck><h2>Question of perspective</h2>
<p>Someone who has had to deal directly with suffering and death in a viral context inevitably has a completely different perspective than someone who has only dealt with numbers and curves up to now. Therefore, it is better to show more humility!</p></a>
<a id="S46" spellcheck><h2>You go to a hospital!</h2>
<p>Who does not want to adhere to measures felt as nonsensical, operates the overloading of hospitals with. And should then please also go there and help out - gladly also without mask!</p></a>
<a id="S47" spellcheck><h2>Imagine your guilt</h2>
<p>If you feel the need to break out of the new normal, just realize how it would feel to be directly responsible for someone else's serious illness or death!</p></a>
<a id="S48" spellcheck><h2>Know someone</h2>
<p>It must be a really dangerous virus because I know someone in my family and/or acquaintances who has been seriously ill or died from the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S49" spellcheck><h2>No forced vaccination</h2>
<p>No one will be forced to be vaccinated. You just have to accept that you will no longer be allowed to travel and participate in social life.</p></a>
<a id="S50" spellcheck><h2>Can't protect risk groups</h2>
<p>When a quarter of the population belongs to the risk group, it is no longer possible to protect them. Therefore, we can't help but stick to the current strategy of protecting others.</p></a>
<a id="S51" spellcheck><h2>Signal of solidarity</h2>
<p>Taking the prescribed measures is a sign of solidarity with the quarter of the population that belongs to the risk group. Many members of this group are unable to protect themselves.</p></a>
<a id="S52" spellcheck><h2>Isolation unethical</h2>
<p>Isolating the at-risk group and no longer allowing them to participate in life, as critics suggest, is not an option. Such a demand is unethical and inhumane!</p></a>
<a id="S53" spellcheck><h2>Pregnant women at risk</h2>
<p>Pregnant women have a weaker immune system and thus also belong to the risk group. We should therefore also adhere to the measures for the best possible protection of pregnant women!</p></a>
<a id="S54" spellcheck><h2>Majority trusts</h2>
<p>The majority of the population trusts the policy and the prescribed measures. The policy basically only implements the wishes and specifications of this majority!</p></a>
<a id="S55" spellcheck><h2>Courts work</h2>
<p>There is no need to worry about justice and the separation of powers. After all, lawsuits are filed and the courts even regularly uphold these lawsuits. Anything is possible, and that shows that we have a constitutional state!</p></a>
<a id="S56" spellcheck><h2>Democracy works</h2>
<p>I am not worried about democracy. There are also parties that take a critical stance against the Corona policy. In a democracy, you just have to put your cross in the right place at the next election!</p></a>
<a id="S57" spellcheck><h2>Don't want to get sick</h2>
<p>Because of the possible long-term damage, I personally do not want to be infected with the virus and therefore follow the measures. And I expect the same from my environment!</p></a>
<a id="S58" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality!</h2>
<p>In many countries, a steep excess mortality curve was observed during the Corona waves. The only explanation is that we are dealing with a contagious and dangerous virus!</p></a>
<a id="S59" spellcheck><h2>Infection fatality rate high</h2>
<p>For the virus the most different infection mortality rates (IFR) and thereby also very high were determined. Therefore, it is not yet known how dangerous the virus really is!</p></a>
<a id="S60" spellcheck><h2>Media is balanced</h2>
<p>In my observation, the major media are documenting the virus crisis in a critical, balanced and level-headed manner. There is no reason not to trust them on these issues!</p></a>
<a id="S61" spellcheck><h2>Masks protect</h2>
<p>The everyday mask has been proven to be a useful protection against the novel virus, if only because it retains aerosols. Anyone who does not wear it or does not wear it properly is putting their environment at risk!</p></a>
<a id="S62" spellcheck><h2>No medication available</h2>
<p>For Covid, unlike the flu, there is no drug treatment. This is the main reason why our lives can only return to normal with the vaccine and vaccination!</p></a>
<a id="S63" spellcheck><h2>Deletion good thing</h2>
<p>It's a good thing when social media like Facebook or Youtube delete misinformation.  Otherwise, even more people would believe in the nonsense that is spread there!</p></a>
<a id="S64" spellcheck><h2>Fear Porn</h2>
<p>The fear that many critics have of health dictatorship, compulsory vaccination or even fascism is completely exaggerated! These people spend only too much time in their information bubble.</p></a>
<a id="S65" spellcheck><h2>Doctors not stupid</h2>
<p>Doctors and medical staff in hospitals and intensive care units know best whether we have a medical emergency. They can be trusted more than statistics!</p></a>
<a id="S66" spellcheck><h2>Politics must react</h2>
<p>Politicians have no choice but to react to the situation by prescribing measures. They just implement the specifications of the consulted experts!</p></a>
<a id="S67" spellcheck><h2>Masks sensitize</h2>
<p>Even if masks are not particularly effective, they at least raise awareness! This also contributes to the fact that we all pay more attention not to infect others.</p></a>
<a id="S68" spellcheck><h2>It's now the law</h2>
<p>The measures are within the framework of democracy developed, valid and to be recognized right. Those who oppose them also endanger the general order.</p></a>
<a id="S69" spellcheck><h2>Pay for treatment yourself</h2>
<p>Those who do not take the virus and the disease seriously and behave carelessly should not enjoy insurance coverage in case of illness and should pay for the treatment costs themselves.</p></a>
<a id="S70" spellcheck><h2>Overcoming the virus</h2>
<p>We have to overcome the virus first, so that we can get our normal life back. This would only require a real crackdown with a hard and long lockdown!</p></a>
<a id="S71" spellcheck><h2>Blame for Rules</h2>
<p>The people who break the rules with their parties and family gatherings are to blame for the fact that the measures must be extended further for everyone! That's why tougher punishments are needed!</p></a>
<a id="S72" spellcheck><h2>No dictatorship</h2>
<p>The temporary suspension of fundamental rights to protect the population has nothing to do with the introduction of a 'dictatorship'. Such statements are a trivialization of real dictatorships.</p></a>
<a id="S73" spellcheck><h2>Anti-Semitism</h2>
<p>Those critics and demonstrators who see a world conspiracy a la 'Great Reset' behind the crisis are only serving anti-Semitic clichés. Thus, the Jewish population is exposed to new sweeping hostilities worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="S74" spellcheck><h2>Measures too lax</h2>
<p>The measures taken so far are simply not drastic enough to prevent the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, more are not being taken because too much consideration is given to different sensitivities.</p></a>
<a id="S75" spellcheck><h2>No False Positives</h2>
<p>The number of false-positive PCR tests is negligible, as their specificity is close to 100 percent when performed and evaluated correctly. Implausible findings are checked in practice by additional test procedures.</p></a>
<a id="S76" spellcheck><h2>Super Spreader</h2>
<p>You always have to be on your guard, because a single person can trigger a new wave at any time as a <b>Super Spreader</b>. Whoever does not follow the rules is partly to blame when something like this happens!</p></a>
<a id="S77" spellcheck><h2>Filter bubble</h2>
<p>People who inform themselves about the viral issue via alternative media find themselves in a filter bubble. Unfortunately, this filter bubble massively distorts their perception of reality.</p></a>
<a id="S78" spellcheck><h2>It's a Pandemic!</h2>
<p>We undeniably have a pandemic that continues to threaten humanity. It is completely irresponsible to downplay it and thus possibly contribute to the recklessness of others!</p></a>
<a id="S79" spellcheck><h2>Own Pre-existing Conditions?</h2>
<p>You don't know if you have pre-existing conditions that make you vulnerable to the virus. That's why you can't be too careful!</p></a>
<a id="S80" spellcheck><h2>More dangerous than flu</h2>
<p>The disease caused by the new corona virus is much more often fatal than the normal flu. Therefore, any equation is a dangerous trivialization!</p></a>
<a id="S81" spellcheck><h2>Long COVID</h2>
<p>The disease caused by the new corona virus leads to long-lasting complications in some sufferers. Therefore, it should not be underestimated in any case!</p></a>
<a id="S82" spellcheck><h2>Social Distancing works</h2>
<p>Social distancing measures imposed by governments worldwide have been found to be effective in model studies. One should take these scientific findings seriously!</p></a>
<a id="S83" spellcheck><h2>No suicides</h2>
<p>There is no evidence of an increase in suicides during lockdowns. This argument is falsely made by critics and is an inappropriate offsetting of risks.</p></a>
<a id="S84" spellcheck><h2>Virus Mutations Dangerous</h2>
<p>In the meantime, mutations have emerged that are even more contagious and dangerous than the original virus. They could be a reason why we have to remain in a state of emergency!</p></a>
<a id="S85" spellcheck><h2>One and only Fascism</h2>
<p>Whoever speaks of fascism in connection with the prescribed measures for the containment of the Corona virus, compares apples with pears. Only the real Nazi fascism really deserves this designation!</p></a>
<a id="S86" spellcheck><h2>Treatment forfeited</h2>
<p>Anyone who goes on demonstrations against the Corona measures or refuses to be vaccinated has forfeited their right to covid treatment. This should be applied at the latest in case of a triage situation!</p></a>
<a id="S87" spellcheck><h2>Unrecorded Cases</h2>
<p>Many people fall ill with corona and suffer consequential damage without it even being recorded in any statistics. Therefore, looking at the statistics alone does not allow an evaluation of the crisis!</p></a>
<a id="S88" spellcheck><h2>Lockdowns work</h2>
<p>Lockdowns work. For example, the radical lockdown in Ireland including a movement radius of 5 km was very effective. We just need to follow this pattern for a few weeks to finally overcome the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S89" spellcheck><h2>Herd Immunity no option</h2>
<p>It is scientifically and ethically problematic to allow natural spread of coronavirus when there is no vaccine. Uncontrolled circulation means unnecessary infections, suffering and death.</p></a>
<a id="S90" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines safe</h2>
<p>The vaccines have proven to be sufficiently safe. There are at most rare allergic reactions, for which you just have to be properly prepared.</p></a>
<a id="S91" spellcheck><h2>Infodemic</h2>
<p>Alongside the virus epidemic, we are threatened by an epidemic of dangerous misinformation. This must be fought in the same way, as it provides legitimacy for the many counter-movements worldwide.</p></a>
<a id="S92" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine opponents</h2>
<p>Among the critics are many opponents of vaccination, whose cause contradicts all science.  Vaccinations are tried and tested medical procedures, without which mankind would not be where it is.</p></a>
<a id="S93" spellcheck><h2>Total incidence</h2>
<p>The total number of infected persons, especially the elderly, is also a good measure of the expected burden on the healthcare system. With this information, hospitals can better prepare themselves.</p></a>
<a id="S94" spellcheck><h2>Zero COVID</h2>
<p>It is worthwhile and can be achieved to completely eradicate the virus by consistently interrupting the infection routes. This has already been achieved in some countries around the world.</p></a>
<a id="S95" spellcheck><h2>Disrespectful</h2>
<p>Resisting the Corona measures is disrespectful to hospital and nursing staff as well as the sick and bereaved families of victims. More humility would be appropriate here!</p></a>
<a id="S96" spellcheck><h2>No infertility</h2>
<p>There are no data on infertility. Since the spike protein is different from the oocyte proteins, infertility can be excluded by the generated antibodies.</p></a>
<a id="S97" spellcheck><h2>No gene changes</h2>
<p>Gene changes caused by mRNA vaccination are already impossible because of the different chemical structure of both. The mRNA also does not reach the cell nuclei in which the human genetic material is located.</p></a>
<a id="S98" spellcheck><h2>What about Manaus?</h2>
<p>The attempt to rely on natural herd immunity in the Brazilian city of Manaus has failed miserably. That is why the health system there has collapsed!</p></a>
<a id="S99" spellcheck><h2>Social Media: Domestic authority</h2>
<p>Companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter only make use of their domiciliary rights as private companies when deleting posts and channels. You then have to express your free opinion somewhere else.</p></a>
<a id="S100" spellcheck><h2>Post-Vaccination deaths natural</h2>
<p>The relatively few deaths after Corona vaccinations were simply statistically expected natural deaths. With millions of vaccinations, this happens and is no cause for concern.</p></a>
<a id="S101" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination highly effective</h2>
<p>The vaccinations have now been shown to be highly effective in the pioneering country of Israel. Here, the effectiveness clearly outweighs the few side effects that occur.</p></a>
<a id="S102" spellcheck><h2>Asymptomatic transmission</h2>
<p>There are many cases where people know they have been infected with the virus without any symptoms of illness. This makes it reasonable that we all wear masks until we can protect ourselves with vaccine or medication.</p></a>
<a id="S103" spellcheck><h2>Politicians simply incompetent</h2>
<p>The fact that many of the measures being pursued worldwide to contain the virus are unsuitable is not intentional, but simply an inability on the part of politicians. This has always been the case in other areas as well.</p></a>
<a id="S104" spellcheck><h2>Politician groupthink</h2>
<p>Politicians often impose inappropriate measures by copying other countries on the basis of groupthink rather than pressure or greed for power. Here, of course, media also act as amplifiers.</p></a>
<a id="S105" spellcheck><h2>Israel first free</h2>
<p>Israel will be the first country to be free of Corona measures again due to its rapid vaccination progress. We all just have to get busy to quickly follow these lucky ones.</p></a>
<a id="S106" spellcheck><h2>Number of Fates</h2>
<p>I can deduce the threatening nature of the new virus simply from the fact that I observe many more fates of illness and death in my environment than in previous years. That is enough for me as a clear indicator.</p></a>
<a id="S107" spellcheck><h2>Doctors don't cheat</h2>
<p>I find it inconceivable that doctors and nursing staff falsify death certificates en masse because of financial incentives. Surely one must be able to rely on the medical ethos here!</p></a>
<a id="S108" spellcheck><h2>Immunity only with vaccine</h2>
<p>Given the dangerousness of the virus, people's own immune system is not enough. Therefore, vaccination is unavoidable in order to protect oneself sufficiently and permanently.</p></a>
<a id="S109" spellcheck><h2>Not jeopardize what's been achieved</h2>
<p>The virus is still with us and even if we have much lower numbers again, the measures should remain in place as loosening too soon will always throw us back to square one!</p></a>
<a id="S110" spellcheck><h2>Home office great thing</h2>
<p>The crisis also has its good sides, because it has opened up the possibility for many people to work from home. Everyone should have the right to this in the future as well!</p></a>
<a id="S111" spellcheck><h2>Worse than adverse effects</h2>
<p>Getting sick with covid is much worse than the rare side effects of the vaccine. Therefore, it is not appropriate to discuss them separately from the disease!</p></a>
<a id="S112" spellcheck><h2>Variants make new pandemics</h2>
<p>It can already be foreseen that the many mutations of the virus will form the basis for further pandemics. Therefore, as with the flu, only a regular vaccination program will protect us in the long term.</p></a>
<a id="S113" spellcheck><h2>It's only temporary</h2>
<p>The pandemic can be seen as a temporary phase through which we now have to pass. We should remember that mankind has gone through much worse phases in the past.</p></a>
<a id="S114" spellcheck><h2>B.1.1.7 Mutation</h2>
<p>The British mutant is highly contagious compared to the original virus. Thus, more infected people, more severe courses of disease and more deaths are to be expected!</p></a>
<a id="S115" spellcheck><h2>B.1.351 Mutation</h2>
<p>The South African mutant tricks the human immune system more cleverly. Vaccines could be less effective and one could be re-infected with this variant of the coronavirus after surviving a covid disease!</p></a>
<a id="S116" spellcheck><h2>P1 Mutation</h2>
<p>The Amazon mutant P1 is three times more infectious than the original virus. This is responsible for the catastrophic conditions in Manaus, Brazil!</p></a>
<a id="S117" spellcheck><h2>Immune Escape</h2>
<p>The virus mutations with the genetic variant are E484K more dangerous because they evade the protective action of the human immune system by preventing already formed antibodies from docking.</p></a>
<a id="S118" spellcheck><h2>VIPs are pushing ahead</h2>
<p>Not without reason, influential people regularly organize themselves vaccination ahead of time.This is an unmistakable sign that it is a desirable treatment.</p></a>
<a id="S119" spellcheck><h2>Pollen transmits virus</h2>
<p>According to recent studies, pollen can also transmit the virus. Therefore, it is an additional risk to go out of the house during the time of pollen flight.</p></a>
<a id="S120" spellcheck><h2>Next wave coming</h2>
<p>Even if the numbers fall or are low, easing is too dangerous because it can trigger the next wave at any time. All those who demand such a thing are irresponsible!</p></a>
<a id="S121" spellcheck><h2>Immune system not enough</h2>
<p>The virus is so tricky that the body's own immune system is sometimes unable to fight it off. That is why not only people with a weak immune system fall ill and die.</p></a>
<a id="S122" spellcheck><h2>Tanzania's president ill</h2>
<p>The president of Tanzania, who has so far refused to acknowledge the danger of the virus, has now died from it himself. This is another warning not to underestimate the risks.</p></a>
<a id="S123" spellcheck><h2>Israel successful</h2>
<p>The vaccination campaign in Israel has been a complete success, preventing both the disease and further contagions there. Herd immunity in the country has almost been achieved.</p></a>
<a id="S124" spellcheck><h2>AIDS also underestimated</h2>
<p>AIDS was also not properly assessed in the initial phase. Many additional victims had to be mourned before those affected took the risk seriously and really protected themselves.</p></a>
<a id="S125" spellcheck><h2>Measures: everyone healthier</h2>
<p>The drastic statistical decrease in all other respiratory diseases can only be seen as a success of the measures. Masks and distance make us all healthier and for that they have already been worthwhile.</p></a>
<a id="S126" spellcheck><h2>Smarter than the rest?</h2>
<p>Do you really think you are smarter than the rest of the world with your views on the crisis? How can you be so sure of your facts and your conclusions?</p></a>
<a id="S127" spellcheck><h2>Doctors' organizations?</h2>
<p>When even medical organizations like the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the Cap Anamur Emergency Physicians Committee classify Corona as a real risk, you can be sure of it!</p></a>
<a id="S128" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine egoism real problem</h2>
<p>Rich countries gain advantages in order to get sufficient vaccine doses faster than the rest of the world. This injustice is the real problem!</p></a>
<a id="S129" spellcheck><h2>Business lobbying prolonges</h2>
<p>Time and again, the business community with its lobbyists interferes in politics and prevents effective measures or softens them. Without these interventions, we would have been through the crisis long ago, like other countries.</p></a>
<a id="S130" spellcheck><h2>FLICC principle</h2>
<p>Corona-critical positions are PLURV, i.e. taken only by pseudo-experts mostly unfamiliar with the subject, based on disinformation and full of logical errors. Instead, one should orientate oneself only to real experts.</p></a>
<a id="S131" spellcheck><h2>Why masks in surgeries?</h2>
<p>If masks do not help, why do surgeons wear them during their operations? From this alone, one can deduce that these masks are at least partially effective against viruses.</p></a>
<a id="S132" spellcheck><h2>Researchers are heroes</h2>
<p>The researchers behind the vaccine development are real heroes who deserve their award. Without them, we would have many more victims to mourn and would have to endure the pandemic for much longer.</p></a>
<a id="S133" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates Philanthropist</h2>
<p>Bill Gates is being attacked completely unjustly, because he has unselfishly donated his wealth to medical progress and thus brought humanity further with his foundation than anyone else.</p></a>
<a id="S134" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination Little Sacrifice</h2>
<p>Getting vaccinated is everyone's contribution to helping the world rid itself of the pandemic. The minimal risk of side effects is a small sacrifice compared to the chance for everyone to return to normal life.</p></a>
<a id="S135" spellcheck><h2>Digital Vaccination Card Solution</h2>
<p>Because we can only defeat the pandemic if as many people as possible are vaccinated, the digital vaccination card helps us as a ticket and thus motivator to get closer to this goal as quickly as possible.</p></a>
<a id="S136" spellcheck><h2>Millions dead</h2>
<p>If measures such as lockdowns and curfews had not been taken worldwide, we would have had millions more deaths, according to reliable model calculations. That is simply the science of forecasting.</p></a>
<a id="S137" spellcheck><h2>Big Pharma Indispensable</h2>
<p>We as humanity would not be where we are now without the great risks taken by the pharmaceutical industry in the development of active ingredients. These companies are far too little appreciated.</p></a>
<a id="S138" spellcheck><h2>Masks harmless</h2>
<p>Wearing masks should not cause any health problems for healthy children and adults. For exceptional cases, a mask exemption certificate can always be presented.</p></a>
<a id="S139" spellcheck><h2>Virus fatal worldwide</h2>
<p>Worldwide, the unchecked spread of the virus has caused catastrophic conditions at many infection sites. The measures taken elsewhere have successfully suppressed this spread.</p></a>
<a id="S140" spellcheck><h2>What about India?</h2>
<p>In India, the health care system is completely overloaded by the dangerous mutant and we do not want to have the same situation here! Therefore, the danger from mutants should not be underestimated.</p></a>
<a id="S141" spellcheck><h2>Vitamin D unproven</h2>
<p>It is not proven whether vitamin D is suitable for the prevention of severe covid progression. There is a greater risk of overdosing with the vitamin and experiencing undesirable side effects such as kidney stones.</p></a>
<a id="S142" spellcheck><h2>PCR tests reliable</h2>
<p>The PCR test method is proven and has a high reliability, which is documented by many studies. Doubtful findings are usually confirmed by testing further gene sections.</p></a>
<a id="S143" spellcheck><h2>Prevention Paradox</h2>
<p>The success of preventive measures makes people lose their sense of danger. Moreover, since they bring little benefit to the individual, acceptance of both the measures - and the important vaccination - suffers.</p></a>
<a id="S144" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated will be sick</h2>
<p>People who do not get vaccinated are very likely to end up with covid, since the virus has only a few carriers left. Non-vaccinated people will thus be responsible for not ending the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S145" spellcheck><h2>Gurgling does little</h2>
<p>The assumption that you can protect yourself from contracting the virus by gargling or other home remedies is false. Such medical misinformation can be life-threatening.</p></a>
<a id="S146" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination of children unavoidable</h2>
<p>Vaccinating children is also unavoidable in order to end the pandemic. It is also a question of intergenerational justice that children have access to the vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="S147" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine Shedding Nonsense</h2>
<p>That non-vaccinated people can be 'infected' by vaccinated people and should therefore stay away from them is nonsense. It is sad when they now start to follow hygiene rules like masks.</p></a>
<a id="S148" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating gives vitality</h2>
<p>The vaccination gave me back strength and vitality. And I have had a feeling of lightness ever since that feels so good that I recommend others to get vaccinated soon.</p></a>
<a id="S149" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating sets you free</h2>
<p>In addition to safety, the freedoms that are restored by politics after vaccination are reason enough to vaccinate. The refusers will then lead a life of deprivation.</p></a>
<a id="S150" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating means love</h2>
<p>Vaccinating oneself is a question of solidarity with one's fellow human beings. The prospect of overcoming the pandemic with a joint effort should be enough to undergo this minor intervention.</p></a>
<a id="S151" spellcheck><h2>Delta Variant Dangerous</h2>
<p>The Indian mutant B1.617 is causing untold suffering in its country of origin and is currently spreading worldwide. This clearly shows that even at low incidences, neither the pandemic nor the risk to individuals is over.</p></a>
<a id="S152" spellcheck><h2>Telegram dangerous</h2>
<p>The Russian messenger Telegram, where criminals and Nazis hang out, is doubly dangerous: privacy is not taken very seriously there and nowhere is more false information spread. Do not use it under any circumstances!</p></a>
<a id="S153" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated are only simulating</h2>
<p>People who have been sick for days after their vaccination are partly just malingerers. And it is also tempting to take a few days off after the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S154" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated put others at risk</h2>
<p>In the end, everyone must be vaccinated so that we can successfully defeat the virus. Everyone who is re-vaccinated is a permanent threat to everyone else, which can only be countered by isolation.</p></a>
<a id="S155" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated make mutations</h2>
<p>The virus not only spreads unhindered through unvaccinated people but can also mutate more. Therefore, every unvaccinated person increases the risk that new dangerous mutations will emerge and further prevent our return to normality.</p></a>
<a id="S156" spellcheck><h2>Half-knowledge dangerous</h2>
<p>Many critics are completely unjustifiably sure of their case and their arguments, as they are usually based on only half-knowledge. Only experts really have the full knowledge that enables them to assess the situation.</p></a>
<a id="S157" spellcheck><h2>Politicians want re-election</h2>
<p>The regulatory frenzy of politicians, which sometimes goes beyond the target, can also be explained simply by the fact that they want to be re-elected. They hope to achieve this by giving the majority a sense of security.</p></a>
<a id="S158" spellcheck><h2>Chaos Theory Explains it</h2>
<p>One needs only the chaos theory and no conspiracy theories to explain the crisis. In general, chaos and incompetence as the simplest explanation is the most likely.</p></a>
<a id="S159" spellcheck><h2>Many more dead than official</h2>
<p>The number of unreported corona deaths worldwide is certainly many times higher than the official figures suggest. Therefore, we can also assume that the risk for all of us is many times higher.</p></a>
<a id="S160" spellcheck><h2>Travel irresponsible</h2>
<p>People who still travel in the current crisis are behaving highly irresponsibly. Every traveler carries a risk of carrying viruses and viral mutations to or from other countries.</p></a>
<a id="S161" spellcheck><h2>Refuting Bullshit Harder</h2>
<p>Reasonable scientists and journalists cannot compete with the many, constantly new slanted claims and theories of the critics. Refuting bullshit requires a power of ten more energy than producing it.</p></a>
<a id="S162" spellcheck><h2>Protests increase incidence</h2>
<p>The people who are taking to the streets worldwide against the Corona measures are partly to blame for our failure to overcome the pandemic. Each new protest march without masks and distance increases the incidence.</p></a>
<a id="S163" spellcheck><h2>Zoonotic diseases are on the rise</h2>
<p>Because we are thoughtlessly overexploiting exotic animals, there will be even more spillovers of pathogens (zoonoses) in the future. This is just a natural 'lesson' for us humans.</p></a>
<a id="S164" spellcheck><h2>Will endure vaccination</h2>
<p>Even if the vaccination should be problematic: My immune system is strong enough to cope with the vaccination. The advantages, e.g. the possibility to travel again, clearly outweigh the disadvantages.</p></a>
<a id="S165" spellcheck><h2>Vaxxing for travel</h2>
<p>I don't necessarily want the vaccination, but if I'm otherwise not allowed to travel in the future, I'll make the sacrifice. After all, life is short and you should savor it.</p></a>
<a id="S166" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating protects the weak</h2>
<p>Those who refuse vaccination, even though they have a healthy and strong body, do so to the detriment of the weak. Because even if the disease cannot harm you, it can harm someone weaker whom you could infect.</p></a>
<a id="S167" spellcheck><h2>Not yet immune</h2>
<p>Only after the pandemic will it be possible to live tolerably with the virus. We still have to wait until then, until the vast majority is immune to the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S168" spellcheck><h2>Contact tracing solution</h2>
<p>The best solution for living with the virus in the future with as little risk as possible is consistent contact tracking. Therefore, the use of appropriate apps should be mandatory.</p></a>
<a id="S169" spellcheck><h2>Information Laziness</h2>
<p>Critics who do not take the crisis seriously enough are often simply too lazy to inform themselves sufficiently. Unfortunately, this laziness can be their and others' undoing.</p></a>
<a id="S170" spellcheck><h2>What can be done?</h2>
<p>Even if the critics were right with their theories about the virus, the crisis and the vaccination, what would one have from this knowledge? If it really were a conspiracy, what can one do about it as an individual?</p></a>
<a id="S171" spellcheck><h2>Virus natural</h2>
<p>There is enough evidence that the virus is of natural origin and entered our world through zoonosis, i.e. the jump from an animal to a human. Claims that it could have come from a laboratory in Wuhan have no basis.</p></a>
<a id="S172" spellcheck><h2>Chinaphobia</h2>
<p>Claims that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan and was deliberately sent into the world by the Chinese government must first be proven. Spreading it without proof only fuels hostility towards China.</p></a>
<a id="S173" spellcheck><h2>Testing prevents outbreaks</h2>
<p>The current testing strategy helps contain the virus because infected individuals can be detected and isolated more quickly through testing. We must also accept the sacrifice of fewer unnecessarily isolated false positives to achieve this.</p></a>
<a id="S174" spellcheck><h2>Just money-making</h2>
<p>The many lawyers around the world who promise to help people get their rights through lawsuits, for example in matters of unjustified measures, are just making money. People should think twice before investing their money in such lawsuits.</p></a>
<a id="S175" spellcheck><h2>Supervised</h2>
<p>We are all already transparent people for corporations and intelligence agencies. Those who are now painting a surveillance state like in China on the wall have not even realized the current situation.</p></a>
<a id="S176" spellcheck><h2>Protesting egoists</h2>
<p>Those who are now taking to the streets without masks and distance are just affluent egoists. They had better face up to the reality of the pandemic and submit so that we can all get our free lives back at some point.</p></a>
<a id="S177" spellcheck><h2>I just don't believe</h2>
<p>All these stories about some evil plans of dark forces are only speculations. One must always ask oneself the question about the sense. Why should they do that? What would they gain from it?</p></a>
<a id="S178" spellcheck><h2>Explainable by profit</h2>
<p>Almost everything that conspiracy theorists want to explain with complicated conspiracies can also be explained simply with the pursuit of profit. Currently hundreds of billions in the vaccination and testing business.</p></a>
<a id="S179" spellcheck><h2>Ockham's razor</h2>
<p>The principle of Occam's razor, which is common in science, can also be applied to the current situation: Of several possible explanations for the same state of affairs, the simplest theory is preferable to all others.</p></a>
<a id="S180" spellcheck><h2>Close the gaps</h2>
<p>If the whole world needs to be vaccinated to end the pandemic, rich countries must work to fund vaccines for the poor in Africa and elsewhere. This is the only way to close the vaccination gaps!</p></a>
<a id="S181" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects show effectiveness</h2>
<p>The sometimes severe side effects experienced by vaccinated individuals after vaccination are a sign that strong immune protection is building up and are an unmistakable sign that the vaccination is taking effect.</p></a>
<a id="S182" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is responsibility</h2>
<p>All those who vaccinate are making an important contribution to the common good and society as a whole. These people can be proud of themselves for making this small sacrifice for everyone.</p></a>
<a id="S183" spellcheck><h2>No rights for the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people who shirk their social responsibilities should not get back the freedoms that were curtailed to fight the crisis. This is also a strong incentive to reconsider their decision.</p></a>
<a id="S184" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates doesn't need money</h2>
<p>The many insinuations and conspiracy accusations to which Bill Gates is exposed make no sense at all, because man already has so much money, he doesn't need any more.</p></a>
<a id="S185" spellcheck><h2>All WHO claims</h2>
<p>The uniform Corona policy and selection of measures worldwide has its basis in the guidelines and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, no hidden intentions can be imputed to the policy here.</p></a>
<a id="S186" spellcheck><h2>New start urgently needed</h2>
<p>The Great Reset, as planned by the members of the World Economic Forum, has no alternative. A new start is urgently needed in many areas in order to preserve our living space for the future.</p></a>
<a id="S187" spellcheck><h2>Expropriate Pharmaceutical Patents</h2>
<p>The real problem is that the pharmaceutical companies are making billions with these vaccines developed with taxpayers' money. The only sensible thing to do in this case would be to convert the patents into common property.</p></a>
<a id="S188" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated undesirables</h2>
<p>In the U.S., vaccinated people are already being discriminated against in many states because people have been persuaded by fake news about infectious vaccines. This clearly shows that we need to get a better handle on misinformation.</p></a>
<a id="S189" spellcheck><h2>No Harmful Substances</h2>
<p>There are enough studies of masks and test kits that have shown that there are no toxins, contamination or harmful substances. You can rely on the safety structures here.</p></a>
<a id="S190" spellcheck><h2>mRNA also anti-cancer</h2>
<p>mRNA technology is a boon to humanity that will help fight many more diseases in the near future. Cancer is already in the works as the next use case.</p></a>
<a id="S191" spellcheck><h2>One would have started in Africa</h2>
<p>If mass vaccination were a population control measure, it would have started in Africa instead of in the industrialized nations. This fact already deprives the absurd thesis of any basis.</p></a>
<a id="S192" spellcheck><h2>Adverse effects easy to report</h2>
<p>Worldwide, vaccination side effects have been recorded in corresponding public registries for decades. These very straightforward reports therefore allow us to make a good estimate of the true proportion of side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S193" spellcheck><h2>Relying on others</h2>
<p>Opponents of vaccination are egoists who rely on the willingness of the vaccinated to take a tiny risk for the good of all. Because they refuse vaccination, we all have to hold out longer.</p></a>
<a id="S194" spellcheck><h2>Politicians love power</h2>
<p>Overly restrictive, perverse or excessive measures that politicians impose faster than they take them back are merely a sign of individuals' obsession with power.</p></a>
<a id="S195" spellcheck><h2>Distributed among hospitals</h2>
<p>The fact that the crisis has triggered fewer supply bottlenecks in countries with good healthcare systems, such as Germany, than in others is due to the even distribution of patients among the available hospitals.</p></a>
<a id="S196" spellcheck><h2>No basic immunity</h2>
<p>There is still no basic immunity in the population against the novel virus and its many mutations. Therefore, the vaccination campaign must be carried through to the end.</p></a>
<a id="S197" spellcheck><h2>Everything has side effects</h2>
<p>Everything, even supposedly harmless foods and medicines, has a certain probability of side effects. If you are brave enough for aspirin or chocolate, you can also get vaccinated against the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S198" spellcheck><h2>Local outbreaks proof</h2>
<p>The many local outbreaks of the virus, e.g. at parties, in businesses or in homes, which have been reported in the media, are proof enough of its dangerousness. We must always be aware of this risk.</p></a>
<a id="S199" spellcheck><h2>Thromboses always happen</h2>
<p>The risk of thrombosis exists in many contexts, such as flying, birth control pills, and corona disease. So far, thromboses occurring after vaccination have been rarer than in these contexts.</p></a>
<a id="S200" spellcheck><h2>Died WITH not BY the vaccine</h2>
<p>A large number of people die in the country every day. If the entire population gets vaccinated within a very short period of time, deaths after vaccination are statistically expected.</p></a>
<a id="S201" spellcheck><h2>Protects against severe courses</h2>
<p>Vaccination does not protect against infection with the virus, but it does protect against a severe course of the viral disease. This protection benefits oneself and also the community by helping to protect the healthcare system from overuse.</p></a>
<a id="S202" spellcheck><h2>Cases only in the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>Severe courses of corona are increasingly occurring only in the unvaccinated due to the ongoing vaccination campaign. Therefore, the unvaccinated put themselves and the health care system in unnecessary danger by their refusal.</p></a>
<a id="S203" spellcheck><h2>Relaxing measures is an experiment</h2>
<p>Repealing all policy-imposed measures is an irresponsible experiment. Measures on a certain scale have now become indispensable to protect the health care system.</p></a>
<a id="S204" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinating children protect all</h2>
<p>Vaccinated children help protect many other vulnerable groups from Corona infection, even without being one of them. Only with the solidary vaccination of the children we come to an effective vaccination rate.</p></a>
<a id="S205" spellcheck><h2>Organ damage from Long Covid</h2>
<p>Permanent organ damage such as heart muscle inflammation and cardiac arrhythmias, as well as lung damage and respiratory problems, are common diagnoses of Long Covid patients. Unfortunately, there is no reporting system for these long-term consequences.</p></a>
<a id="S206" spellcheck><h2>Disinformation Dozen</h2>
<p>Among the Corona fake news spreaders on the Internet, twelve people in particular have been identified. If the distribution channels of this 'disinformation dozen' were blocked, the crisis could be handled much better right away.</p></a>
<a id="S207" spellcheck><h2>Every day a plane crash or 9/11</h2>
<p>The Covid casualty figures are best placed in a disaster context like a plane crash to understand their magnitude. No one would want to maintain a situation like the current pandemic under these circumstances.</p></a>
<a id="S208" spellcheck><h2>Sacrifice few to protect many more</h2>
<p>The principle of vaccination has always been to sacrifice a few to save many. This is also the case with the Corona vaccine, and no one claims that there are no side effects at all, but only a vanishingly small number.</p></a>
<a id="S209" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination makes more economic sense</h2>
<p>From an economic point of view, the principle of vaccination is simply the more sensible solution in relation to the mass natural passing through of a disease. The aspect of sick leave should be included in decisions.</p></a>
<a id="S210" spellcheck><h2>Dull criticism of capitalism</h2>
<p>Criticism of the profits and contractual practices of the large vaccine manufacturers is only a dull, inappropriate critique of capitalism. In the medical context, where life and death are at stake, different standards must be applied.</p></a>
<a id="S211" spellcheck><h2>mRNA technology has long been mature</h2>
<p>The mRNA vaccine is a solution that has long since matured after many years of research. Only the studies were not continued because previous corona virus pandemics like SARS have ended on their own.</p></a>
<a id="S212" spellcheck><h2>Locking out non-vaccinated people to protect them</h2>
<p>Regulations to exclude the unvaccinated from social life, cultural events and stores also serve their own protection. After all, they can regain access at any time by being vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="S213" spellcheck><h2>No right to infect others</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people do not have to vaccinate themselves, but by not vaccinating they practically take away the right to infect others. Therefore, the state must ensure the physical integrity of others through isolation.</p></a>
<a id="S214" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are trained</h2>
<p>The dissenters typically do not have medical training to assess the correctness of the Corona measures supported by the vast majority of physicians. They should therefore be cautious about their views.</p></a>
<a id="S215" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are experienced</h2>
<p>The dissenters typically do not have the experience as physicians to assess the correctness of the Corona measures supported by the vast majority of physicians. They should therefore be cautious in their assessments.</p></a>
<a id="S216" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are mild</h2>
<p>Although there is a lot of talk about side effects of vaccination, this usually refers to mild side effects such as short-term pain in the arm or headaches. These effects can also be observed with other vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S217" spellcheck><h2>Safety standards complied with</h2>
<p>While the vaccines were developed in an accelerated process to get results faster, all safety standards were met in the process. Therefore, one can have confidence in them.</p></a>
<a id="S218" spellcheck><h2>Sufficiently less contagious</h2>
<p>Vaccinated people therefore no longer have to test themselves because they are sufficiently less contagious compared to unvaccinated people. Not having to be tested is also another incentive to vaccinate.</p></a>
<a id="S219" spellcheck><h2>What pressure?</h2>
<p>The alleged social pressure to vaccinate is in fact no pressure at all, but merely a sensible policy in the sense of epidemiology. Whoever refuses this cannot speak of repression.</p></a>
<a id="S220" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinations greatest achievement</h2>
<p>It is common knowledge that vaccination is one of the greatest medical achievements in human history. It is incomprehensible that so many people have turned away from this concept.</p></a>
<a id="S221" spellcheck><h2>No right to eat in a restaurant</h2>
<p>The restrictions on the unvaccinated are merely political measures to contain a pandemic. People cannot invoke their basic rights when they are excluded from restaurants and stores.</p></a>
<a id="S222" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to contribute</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people do not care about our fate, they do not want to contribute to a normal life again. This shows how stupid and uneducated our society has become!</p></a>
<a id="S223" spellcheck><h2>Fear of control = more control</h2>
<p>In the end, the fear of state control in the Corona context only creates the prerequisite for the need for even more state control. This vicious circle can only be broken by obedience.</p></a>
<a id="S224" spellcheck><h2>Seeing DNA change as an opportunity</h2>
<p>Somewhat ironically, one could call out to the particularly illogical vaccination refusers: Those who believe that an mRNA vaccination would change their DNA had better see it as an opportunity!</p></a>
<a id="S225" spellcheck><h2>100% vaccination rate = 100% vaccinated sick people</h2>
<p>The reference to vaccinated people who are also infected with the virus and treated in hospital makes little sense if large parts of the population have already been vaccinated. With a 100% vaccination rate, all sick people are also vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="S226" spellcheck><h2>Be calm, it'll soon be over</h2>
<p>The pandemic will eventually be over, and until then we should just be more relaxed. With the great goal of ending the pandemic in mind, the measures will be much easier to endure.</p></a>
<a id="S227" spellcheck><h2>Vaccines no long-term effects</h2>
<p>The current Corona vaccines cannot have any negative long-term effects, if only because their principle of operation renders them ineffective in a short time. Concerns in this regard are unfounded.</p></a>
<a id="S228" spellcheck><h2>Pharma companies communicates poorly</h2>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry already does some 'crooked' things and communicates poorly. But to use that as a reason for refusal in the Corona context is inappropriate because it keeps us all stuck in the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S229" spellcheck><h2>We only have to vaccinate everyone</h2>
<p>If everyone were vaccinated, there would be significantly fewer infections and the healthcare system would be far from overloaded. With a maximum vaccination rate, we would have overcome the pandemic long ago.</p></a>
<a id="S230" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated are threat</h2>
<p>Within a pandemic, the unvaccinated are a threat to society, as their refusal makes it impossible to overcome the crisis together. Society therefore has a right to defend itself against them.</p></a>
<a id="S231" spellcheck><h2>Not a doctor / scientist</h2>
<p>Uu Corona Dissenters are not doctors or scientists and are therefore unable to see the complex situation. More trust in the knowledge and experience of the experts would be appropriate.</p></a>
<a id="S232" spellcheck><h2>Don't know any</h2>
<p>I do not know any who have serious side effects in their family and acquaintances. The problem may thus not be so relevant, at the same time I definitely know many Corona victims.</p></a>
<a id="S233" spellcheck><h2>Do not allow the state to be blackmailed</h2>
<p>The state must not allow itself to be blackmailed by the dissenters on Corona and their protest actions. In the pandemic, it must first and foremost ensure that the interests of the majority are enforced.</p></a>
<a id="S234" spellcheck><h2>Exclusion is important</h2>
<p>Excluding the unvaccinated from social life has an important educational function. They must be made aware that they are contributing to an unnecessary prolongation of the exceptional situation.</p></a>
<a id="S235" spellcheck><h2>Side effects / vaccination deaths coincidence</h2>
<p>Many people die every day. This fact alone also results in a probability of dying after a vaccination. We experience these as supposed side effects and vaccination deaths in connection with a high number of vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S236" spellcheck><h2>Relaxations only with a high vaccination rate</h2>
<p>The call for relaxations must not be followed because a high vaccination rate is a prerequisite for the withdrawal of measures. This relationship has been clearly demonstrated by field studies in other countries.</p></a>
<a id="S237" spellcheck><h2>Just personal anecdotes</h2>
<p>When people report side effects in themselves or in their environment, these are only personal anecdotes that cannot be generalized and have no statistical relevance.</p></a>
<a id="S238" spellcheck><h2>Nothing happens with billions</h2>
<p>If you include the side effect reports, virtually nothing has happened with billions of vaccinations. The advantages of the globally successful vaccination campaign clearly outweigh the disadvantages.</p></a>
<a id="S239" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people get sick worse</h2>
<p>The unvaccinated have been shown to contract corona the fastest and worst, and are more likely to end up in intensive care. They are thus more likely to become a burden on the healthcare system.</p></a>
<a id="S240" spellcheck><h2>Delegitimization of the state by critics</h2>
<p>The state must resist all attempts to be delegitimized by Corona critics. This danger exists especially if the executive branch does not take decisive action against violations of laws and regulations.</p></a>
<a id="S241" spellcheck><h2>Not spreading nonsense is not one-sided</h2>
<p>Media that refrain from spreading unsubstantiated information or even total nonsense do not automatically report in a one-sided manner. They are committed to certain quality standards that do not apply in Telegram.</p></a>
<a id="S242" spellcheck><h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect works with dissenters. They are incompetent people who overestimate their own knowledge and are incapable of judging themselves objectively by means of metacognition.</p></a>
<a id="S243" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy places</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people fall ill more often and more severely during the pandemic, which results in a higher occupancy of hospital beds by them. These beds are no longer available for other patients.</p></a>
<a id="S244" spellcheck><h2>State of the art</h2>
<p>The image presented to the public on the crisis and its background is created by recourse to experts and represents the state of science. Everything else is unscientific sideshow.</p></a>
<a id="S245" spellcheck><h2>You do not have the absolute truth</h2>
<p>Many dissenters often appear so self-confident and convinced, as if they had the truth. One cannot take them seriously, if only because of their lack of self-criticism.</p></a>
<a id="S246" spellcheck><h2>Self-proclaimed critics/journalists</h2>
<p>Many pretentious and incompetent people appear in the Corona context as critics/journalists without having the necessary competences. These are rightly written down or ignored by the major media.</p></a>
<a id="S247" spellcheck><h2>State cares, makes vaccinations free</h2>
<p>The state cares for its citizens in the pandemic by providing vaccinations free of charge to all. It is ungrateful and selfish to refuse this offer for the benefit of all.</p></a>
<a id="S248" spellcheck><h2>Defiance phase like with children</h2>
<p>The negative attitude of vaccination opponents, often without any evidence, is strongly reminiscent of the defiant phase known from childhood, which one should actually have overcome in adulthood.</p></a>
<a id="S249" spellcheck><h2>Do not reward the unsolid</h2>
<p>Unsound behavior must not be further rewarded in the context of vaccination and interventions, otherwise the basic pillars of our society will be put at risk.</p></a>
<a id="S250" spellcheck><h2>Higher contributions for vaccination refusers</h2>
<p>Vaccine refusers are irresponsible with their bodies, comparable to couch potatoes or bungee jumpers. They are a burden on the community and should be charged higher premiums.</p></a>
<a id="S251" spellcheck><h2>The government would never do that</h2>
<p>I cannot imagine my own government being ruthless enough for such a far-reaching deception of its own people. The assumptions of the critics in this direction are unrealistic.</p></a>
<a id="S252" spellcheck><h2>WITH but not ON: double standards</h2>
<p>Just as one can argue that many have died not ON but WITH the virus, one can argue analogously that many have died not ON but WITH the vaccination. Who does not want to see this, measures with double standards.</p></a>
<a id="S253" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>The unvaccinated are largely responsible for the continuation of the pandemic, as they fall ill more frequently and more severely, thus overburdening the medical care structures. This is the pandemic of the unvaccinated!</p></a>
<a id="S254" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs because not 100% protection</h2>
<p>Vaccination breakthroughs can be explained because the vaccination just does not protect 100%. In particular, pre-existing conditions and other factors can greatly reduce its effectiveness.</p></a>
<a id="S255" spellcheck><h2>Only non-vaccinated people in intensive care units</h2>
<p>According to official data from hospitals, almost only unvaccinated patients are treated in intensive care units. If you want to relieve the intensive care units, you have to start with them!</p></a>
<a id="S256" spellcheck><h2>The only thing missing is the next booster</h2>
<p>The reason for the increase in covid cases even among vaccinated people is that their vaccination is already too far behind to be sufficiently effective. They just lack the booster to continue escaping the disease.</p></a>
<a id="S257" spellcheck><h2>Zoo animals also already vaccinated</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, even zoo animals are vaccinated against Corona. As an unvaccinated person, you don't want to be inferior to them and possibly belong to the last disease-prone creatures on earth.</p></a>
<a id="S258" spellcheck><h2>Heart problems only imagined</h2>
<p>Many people misinterpret signals from their own body due to misinformation on the net and imagine that they will have heart problems or similar after vaccination. People can also be unnecessarily frightened of such a harmless procedure.</p></a>
<a id="S259" spellcheck><h2>In the past also &lsquo;suddenly and unexpectedly&rsquo;</h2>
<p>In the past, too, people died suddenly and unexpectedly. Now people blame vaccination for such cases because it fits better with their own point of view.</p></a>
<a id="S260" spellcheck><h2>Critics just look for matching papers</h2>
<p>Corona critics look for the appropriate scientific papers for their views on the net, without knowing the correct procedure, let alone being able to read the papers properly.</p></a>
<a id="S261" spellcheck><h2>Own freedom stops with the others</h2>
<p>The deliberately unvaccinated are a health hazard for everyone else around them. In their insistence on their freedoms, they overlook the fact that these freedoms end where the rights of others begin.</p></a>
<a id="S262" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated courage fills hospitals</h2>
<p>Before vaccination, many people refrained from hospital visits for fear of infection. Now, with renewed courage, they are filling hospitals with many non-Corona-related cases.</p></a>
<a id="S263" spellcheck><h2>All side effects also with Covid</h2>
<p>All the potentially feared side effects of vaccination, including thrombosis, myocarditis, etc., occur much more frequently and with a more severe course with Covid infection. Clearly, one should be afraid of Covid infection.</p></a>
<a id="S264" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated are still not dead</h2>
<p>That vaccinated people will die in a few months has probably turned out to be misinformation after all, because we vaccinated people are still not dead. Something must have gone wrong with this prognosis.</p></a>
<a id="S265" spellcheck><h2>Functioning society only with commitment</h2>
<p>You can't have everything without also giving something in return. There is no place for selfishness in a functioning society, and selfish people must be made to feel it.</p></a>
<a id="S266" spellcheck><h2>Triage for non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>I support triage for the unvaccinated, because anyone who doesn't get vaccinated now acts at their own risk and shouldn't be able to take a spot in the ICU away from anyone.</p></a>
<a id="S267" spellcheck><h2>Egoism accusation freedom of speech</h2>
<p>The accusation of selfishness against the deliberately unvaccinated naturally falls under the freedom of opinion which they themselves so vehemently propagate. Their indignation about it is therefore tantamount to a double standard.</p></a>
<a id="S268" spellcheck><h2>Just a prick!</h2>
<p>As it has always been true for vaccinations, it's just a little prick that you don't need to be afraid of. Even small children understand that!</p></a>
<a id="S269" spellcheck><h2>Socialist compulsory vaccination has worked well</h2>
<p>Compulsory vaccination could be a possible, restrictive way to overcome the pandemic if all other incentives for voluntary vaccination fail. This has already been done well in former socialist countries.</p></a>
<a id="S270" spellcheck><h2>Who harms the majority =&gt; consequences</h2>
<p>Anyone who makes a decision as an adult that potentially harms the majority society must also bear the consequences of this decision. We cannot afford to be considerate of egoists in a pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S271" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination myths are a problem for everyone</h2>
<p>The many myths and conspiracy narratives circulating on the web keep many people from doing their part to overcome the pandemic. Therefore, it must be seen as a problem for all of us to fight.</p></a>
<a id="S272" spellcheck><h2>If smallpox still had</h2>
<p>All the misinformation on the Internet is preventing us from defeating the virus. Fortunately, the Internet has not been around that long, otherwise mankind would probably never have succeeded in eradicating polio and smallpox.</p></a>
<a id="S273" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are immune reaction</h2>
<p>Side effects do not result from the vaccination, but from the immune reaction triggered by it. The same immune reaction would also have occurred in the specific patient in the case of an infection.</p></a>
<a id="S274" spellcheck><h2>Common good trumps self-determination</h2>
<p>There are situations in which the common good outweighs self-determination and individual freedoms. The current pandemic and the worldwide vaccination campaign to overcome it are precisely such cases.</p></a>
<a id="S275" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous horse dewormer</h2>
<p>The ivermectin advertised by vaccination opponents is an unproven and therefore dangerous drug from veterinary medicine, which is used for deworming horses. One should urgently refrain from treating with it.</p></a>
<a id="S276" spellcheck><h2>Compensation fund for vaccination damage</h2>
<p>Appropriate compensation funds have long since been set up for the rare vaccination injuries that occur and have occurred as a result of mass vaccination. There is no insurance problem.</p></a>
<a id="S277" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs in patients with severe pre-conditions</h2>
<p>The protection provided by vaccination is high, but severe disease can still occur with risk factors such as pre-existing conditions, obesity or suppressed immune system. The vaccination can also not perform miracles.</p></a>
<a id="S278" spellcheck><h2>Long experience with vaccinations</h2>
<p>Mankind has hundreds of years of experience and success with the principle of vaccination behind it. In dealing with the current pandemic, we are all benefiting from this experience. And can be happy about it.</p></a>
<a id="S279" spellcheck><h2>mRNA vaccination is known and safe</h2>
<p>Research on mRNA vaccination has been going on for many decades and therefore side effects and problems are well known. The technology was ready in time for the pandemic and can be considered safe.</p></a>
<a id="S280" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people are pandemic drivers</h2>
<p>The remaining unvaccinated pose a risk of infection to everyone else due to their higher susceptibility to the virus. As drivers of the pandemic, they must be kept away from the public.</p></a>
<a id="S281" spellcheck><h2>Intensive care beds also need staff</h2>
<p>The reference to free intensive care beds does not allow any statement about the real capacities, since personnel is always required to operate them. Looking at the number of beds alone is not meaningful.</p></a>
<a id="S282" spellcheck><h2>Balancing of civil rights</h2>
<p>Those who insist on their basic rights in times of pandemic overlook the right to health of their fellow human beings, which weighs just as much as the claimed rights - and which politicians must therefore weigh up.</p></a>
<a id="S283" spellcheck><h2>Powerlessness against non-vaccinated people</h2>
<p>The indignation of many vaccinated people because of the unvaccinated, who block the resolution of the pandemic with their refusal to vaccinate, is only understandable because of the perceived powerlessness in this situation.</p></a>
<a id="S284" spellcheck><h2>Late effects not to be expected</h2>
<p>Long experience with vaccinations shows that the feared side effects that first appear a long time after vaccination are not to be expected. As a rule, vaccinations take effect within a manageable period of time.</p></a>
<a id="S285" spellcheck><h2>My vaccination prevented worse</h2>
<p>I did go through covid after vaccination, but it would have been much worse if I had not been vaccinated. I am glad to have been vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="S286" spellcheck><h2>Asymptomatic transmission also with herpes</h2>
<p>The effect of assymptomatic transmission is not at all as far-fetched as critics keep making it out to be, but also occurs in other diseases such as herpes.</p></a>
<a id="S287" spellcheck><h2>Individual responsibility</h2>
<p>I feel a personal responsibility for immunocompromised or -suppressed colleagues and relatives and therefore - and not because of my own risk - I adhere to the prescribed measures.</p></a>
<a id="S288" spellcheck><h2>False adverse event reports</h2>
<p>Vaccination opponents flood the adverse reaction reporting system with false reports, just as they have been shown to influence media surveys. Therefore, no conclusions should be drawn from the high reporting figures.</p></a>
<a id="S289" spellcheck><h2>Denmark's about-face?</h2>
<p>What about Denmark's about-face after their Freedom Day? I guess it's not as easy to return to normality as the critics always wish.</p></a>
<a id="S290" spellcheck><h2>How to drive drunk</h2>
<p>Refusing to vaccinate without good reason is like driving drunk, since you are endangering not only yourself but others as well. Sober people also cause accidents, but the probability is lower.</p></a>
<a id="S291" spellcheck><h2>Breakthroughs only in risk groups</h2>
<p>Vaccination breakthroughs are not a general phenomenon, but affect mainly risk groups with pre-existing conditions. This is understandable, as vaccination can have less effect here than in healthy people.</p></a>
<a id="S292" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people take society hostage</h2>
<p>By insisting on their freedom and self-determination over their bodies, the unvaccinated take the sensible rest of society hostage. Because of their attitude, a return to normality is not possible.</p></a>
<a id="S293" spellcheck><h2>No treatment for non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>The unvaccinated, because they knowingly take the greater risk of falling ill and possibly burdening the health care system in the process, must come to terms with being treated as the very last in an overuse situation.</p></a>
<a id="S294" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy beds</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people occupy hospital beds and thus use up the reserves early. As a result, the responsible, vaccinated rest of the population must endure the measures that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p></a>
<a id="S295" spellcheck><h2>Financial participation of non-vaccinated persons</h2>
<p>Consideration should be given to ways in which the unvaccinated can contribute financially to the costs of the ongoing pandemic. They are incurred by society as a whole, but are caused by refusal to vaccinate.</p></a>
<a id="S296" spellcheck><h2>Lax controls irresponsible</h2>
<p>In the catering and club sector, compliance with the rules is often not properly controlled and this can lead to outbreaks again and again. More control of the controllers with severe penalties!</p></a>
<a id="S297" spellcheck><h2>Side effects rate normal</h2>
<p>When the side effects of the Corona vaccine are put in relation to the quantities vaccinated - to billions of people - their proportion becomes vanishingly small - and the risks become comparable to those of classical vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="S298" spellcheck><h2>Compensation solution is long since in place</h2>
<p>As with all other recommended vaccines, there is already a state compensation scheme.  So you are already covered against the risk of becoming a victim of a very rare side effect.</p></a>
<a id="S299" spellcheck><h2>Liability exemption makes vaccination possible</h2>
<p>The exemption from liability for vaccine manufacturers is what makes the successful fight against pandemics possible in the first place. If politicians had insisted on manufacturer liability for damages, we would have no vaccines!</p></a>
<a id="S300" spellcheck><h2>Virus contact inevitable</h2>
<p>In the next three years, it is very likely that everyone will come into contact with the virus. Then one is either dead or recovered, as vaccinated rather the latter.</p></a>
<a id="S301" spellcheck><h2>Duties convince the unwilling</h2>
<p>Other areas of life with corresponding risks show that unwilling people can only be convinced by obligations. A good example of this is the obligation to wear seat belts and helmets in road traffic.</p></a>
<a id="S302" spellcheck><h2>Spain and Portugal successful</h2>
<p>The numbers are lower or falling in countries like Spain and Portugal with high vaccination rates. Their vaccination programs successfully contained the pandemic and are therefore a model for other countries.</p></a>
<a id="S303" spellcheck><h2>Test exemption required as motivation</h2>
<p>The test exemption for vaccinated people is not conclusive, because they can still be infectious. But that is a matter of consideration: The exemption is again as a motivation and incentive to vaccination absolutely sensible.</p></a>
<a id="S304" spellcheck><h2>Side effects rarer than lightning strike</h2>
<p>The risk of fatal side effects from vaccination is lower than being struck by lightning. Fears are therefore irrational and do not do justice to the real probabilities.</p></a>
<a id="S305" spellcheck><h2>After a few days through the body</h2>
<p>The active ingredients of the vaccination are already out of the body a few days or weeks after the injection. And also do not act further than a few centimeters from the injection site.</p></a>
<a id="S306" spellcheck><h2>Cannot penetrate cell nucleus</h2>
<p>The administered genetic information in the mRNA or vector vaccines does not penetrate into cell nuclei. Therefore, there is also no possibility that one's own genetic information could be altered by the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S307" spellcheck><h2>Adverse event reports can be duplicates</h2>
<p>Portals automatically transfer data on adverse events and do not check the reports. The data there are not reliable, since anyone can report something there as often as they want.</p></a>
<a id="S308" spellcheck><h2>So far only lucky with mutations</h2>
<p>So far, we humans have only been lucky during the pandemic that no really dangerous mutations have emerged. Things can get much worse if the virus becomes significantly more deadly or contagious than before.</p></a>
<a id="S309" spellcheck><h2>Covid deaths not registered</h2>
<p>Many covid victims who died in private, who were not hospitalized and who did not undergo testing, constitute an unreported number that skews the statistics heavily in the positive.</p></a>
<a id="S310" spellcheck><h2>Omicron variant</h2>
<p>The mutation B.1.1.529 or Omikron combines the dangerousness of several other mutations. The danger of this variant for the health care system stems in particular from its high infection rate.</p></a>
<a id="S311" spellcheck><h2>Politics has failed</h2>
<p>We would have overcome the pandemic in our own country long ago if politics had not failed. The main causes are a lack of or too lax laws and regulations and insufficient government crackdowns on refuseniks.</p></a>
<a id="S312" spellcheck><h2>Refused tests on Covid deaths</h2>
<p>Families of the deceased often enforce that no test be done or that Covid not be on the death certificate to save themselves the hassle and restrictions of a Covid burial. This distorts the statistics.</p></a>
<a id="S313" spellcheck><h2>Covid victim despite negative test</h2>
<p>Patients who are negative again weeks after the disease can still die from the damage it caused. Covid had better always be assumed as the cause of death if there was a positive test before death.</p></a>
<a id="S314" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination boosts male fertility</h2>
<p>Covid vaccination improves the sperm quality of the male. Thus, it has no negative but even positive effects on male fertility!</p></a>
<a id="S315" spellcheck><h2>Corona infection worsens fertility</h2>
<p>A passed infection with the coronavirus can damage the sexual health of the man. This is another reason why vaccination is a sensible protective measure.</p></a>
<a id="S316" spellcheck><h2>Statistics of one</h2>
<p>People usually base their assessment of risks on their own experience. The fact that they are not ill or that there are no victims in their own environment gives them a false sense of security.</p></a>
<a id="S317" spellcheck><h2>Telegram Fates Are Fake</h2>
<p>The many fates of side effect victims communicated via alternative media channels such as Telegram are typically fabricated. Official, verified sources are better for assessing the real situation.</p></a>
<a id="S318" spellcheck><h2>Current excess mortality is &lsquo;post-harvest&rsquo;</h2>
<p>The significant excess mortality since vaccination campaigns began has nothing to do with vaccination. Rather, the casualties are the natural 'after-harvest' of the closed period created by the previous lockdowns.</p></a>
<a id="S319" spellcheck><h2>No correlation for side effects</h2>
<p>The causal relationship to vaccination cannot be established for most side effects. Diseases and also deaths in a temporal context can be explained as statistical coincidence by the immense number of vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S320" spellcheck><h2>Young people not invulnerable</h2>
<p>Currently, many young people consider themselves invulnerable to the virus and therefore even provoke an infection. However, this is a fallacy that many will pay for with their health or even their lives.</p></a>
<a id="S321" spellcheck><h2>Non-vaccinated people are a risk for all</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated people play with the risk of all, because even a negative test does not protect them from catching the virus. And that they then fall ill, possibly blocking an intensive care bed that an accident victim urgently needs.</p></a>
<a id="S322" spellcheck><h2>Basic trust in processes</h2>
<p>It is paradoxical that people in crisis abandon their trust in some tried-and-tested mechanisms, but cling to them in other areas. The lack of common ground makes them difficult if not impossible to reach.</p></a>
<a id="S323" spellcheck><h2>The world is as it seems</h2>
<p>It is safe to assume that the world out there is as it appears and conspiracies are much more difficult than many think. After all, different interests are difficult to reconcile and agreements are hard to keep secret.</p></a>
<a id="S324" spellcheck><h2>Expertise has its meaning</h2>
<p>Not everyone can be knowledgeable in all areas and it therefore makes sense in the rules to rely on experts instead of overestimating oneself. This division of tasks is what makes our complex world controllable in the first place.</p></a>
<a id="S325" spellcheck><h2>Dangerous to the state</h2>
<p>Some of the critics of Corona's policies no longer believe in the structures and mechanisms of democracy and act in an openly anti-state manner. The state must take more rigorous action against these people to protect the majority.</p></a>
<a id="S326" spellcheck><h2>Aspiration not necessary</h2>
<p>Aspiration before vaccine injection is not necessary, according to official recommendations, because the blood vessels in the upper arm muscle within reach of the needle are too small for accidental intravascular administration.</p></a>
<a id="S327" spellcheck><h2>Pandemics are not a novelty</h2>
<p>In the history of mankind there have always been pandemics, e.g. the Spanish flu, so why not in our time? Currently, the probability of a pandemic is possibly even higher, given the way people act.</p></a>
<a id="S328" spellcheck><h2>Recurring vaccinations have been around for long</h2>
<p>Calling corona booster vaccinations a vaccine subscription or trap suggests that it is a novel feature. In contrast, there have long been recurrent vaccinations, such as the flu vaccine or the tick repellent vaccine.</p></a>
<a id="S329" spellcheck><h2>Of course the pandemic is exploited</h2>
<p>The crisis situation that the pandemic represents worldwide is, of course, being exploited by many interest groups. But this does not necessarily mean that they have also brought about the crisis in the form of an unrealistic, comprehensive conspiracy.</p></a>
<a id="S330" spellcheck><h2>Moral obligation to vaccinate</h2>
<p>Because the crisis can only be overcome with joint effort and joint sacrifice, a kind of moral inoculation obligation applies. Those who exempt themselves may be confronted with this moral violation by their fellow human beings.</p></a>
<a id="S331" spellcheck><h2>Darwin Award for non-vaccinated people</h2>
<p>The sarcastic negative award for people who harm or kill themselves through their own fault, showing a special degree of stupidity, should also be given to the group of unvaccinated people.</p></a>
<a id="S332" spellcheck><h2>Omicron not a wave but a wall</h2>
<p>In the case of the new Omikron variant, its high rate of infection means that we no longer have to speak of an epidemic wave but already of a wall that has the potential to severely overburden the healthcare system.</p></a>
<a id="S333" spellcheck><h2>Politics again and again the same mistakes</h2>
<p>It is true that a nationwide lockdown is not always appropriate, and sometimes tough regional restrictions are enough. But if it says lockdown, it must be lockdown, because we have enough half-hearted policies.</p></a>
<a id="S334" spellcheck><h2>Kennedy was always a nutcase</h2>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy, one of the central figures for the dissenters, has been an irrational opponent of vaccination and a self-proclaimed child protector since before the crisis. Therefore, there is no reason to trust him now.</p></a>
<a id="S335" spellcheck><h2>Athletes also collapsed earlier</h2>
<p>Athletes have always been at risk due to severe physical stress. Without reliable comparative figures from the past, no assessment of athlete collapse is possible.</p></a>
<a id="S336" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims only suspected cases</h2>
<p>All cases reported in the adverse event databases are only suspected cases. A causal relationship to vaccination cannot be established with certainty, so that these figures do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the proportion of vaccine injuries.</p></a>
<a id="S337" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine doses ordered for the third world</h2>
<p>The many vaccines pre-ordered en masse by the EU and other major nations are expected to be made available to poorer countries in the future. They show no alleged plans for a longer duration of the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S338" spellcheck><h2>Clearly a mass psychosis</h2>
<p>The arguments of the Corona critics have meanwhile the character of a mass psychosis with delusions of totalitarian world domination and vaccination conspiracies. This psychosis is mainly fueled by beneficiaries.</p></a>
<a id="S339" spellcheck><h2>Now everything's a vaccine side effect</h2>
<p>Critics of vaccination now seem to interpret every health change in their environment as a vaccination side effect. They ignore the fact that there are coincidences and also that people age and decline in health.</p></a>
<a id="S340" spellcheck><h2>Compulsory vaccination helps save face</h2>
<p>In the meantime, many critics of vaccination have hardly any opportunity to move away from their position and save face. A vaccination obligation helps these people to get out of the blockade attitude by the state default.</p></a>
<a id="S341" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine remains in your arm</h2>
<p>The vaccine cannot be responsible for many alleged side effects at all, since it remains in the arm of the vaccinated person. It is probably a coincidental encounter rather than vaccine effects.</p></a>
<a id="S342" spellcheck><h2>Refreshers useful until the end of the pandemic</h2>
<p>Every individual can contribute to a quick end of the pandemic by following the official recommendations for boosters. Since the effect is limited, boosters are useful until the end of the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S343" spellcheck><h2>Relatively few vaccination breakthroughs</h2>
<p>The highlighting of vaccination breakthroughs by critics serves only to question the effectiveness of vaccination. In reality, there are very few such breakthroughs in relation to the total number of people vaccinated.</p></a>
<a id="S344" spellcheck><h2>Rapid approval to contain the pandemic</h2>
<p>The much-criticized fast-track vaccine testing and approval process was necessary to contain a global pandemic. This speed saved the world from a much worse course of the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="S345" spellcheck><h2>Omicron could end pandemic</h2>
<p>The omicron variant that now prevails, with its much milder course, may spell the end of the pandemic, as it is similar to influenza in its dangerousness. Policymakers could now focus on acceptance of the risk.</p></a>
<a id="S346" spellcheck><h2>Anti-Vaxers in the 19th century</h2>
<p>The rejection of vaccinations already existed with the smallpox vaccination in 19th century Europe. Then, as now, people were led astray by irrational fears and unscientific claims.</p></a>
<a id="S347" spellcheck><h2>Infection is dirty immunization</h2>
<p>Direct infection with the virus without prior vaccination protection is a kind of risky, dirty immunization. It can be done, but vaccination the safe and clean way to your own immunization.</p></a>
<a id="S348" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination signals acceptance of the measures</h2>
<p>The fact that the vast majority of people worldwide opt for vaccination is a clear signal of approval for government protection measures and regulations. Critics, on the other hand, mobilize only a tiny part of the population.</p></a>
<a id="S349" spellcheck><h2>No real discrimination</h2>
<p>The discrimination through social exclusion claimed by vaccination critics is in fact none at all, since vaccination status is not an immutable characteristic like homosexuality and skin color.</p></a>
<a id="S350" spellcheck><h2>I trust the science</h2>
<p>The vast majority of scientists share a unified view on the danger of Corona and on vaccination. These representatives of science should be trusted more than the isolated critics.</p></a>
<a id="S351" spellcheck><h2>Corona shrinks the Penis</h2>
<p>One of the possible long-term consequences of Corona infection for men is the reduction of their penis size. Surely this risk must be reason enough to protect oneself from this fate by vaccination!</p></a>
<a id="S352" spellcheck><h2>Side effects often nocebo effect</h2>
<p>Many vaccination side effects such as headaches are actually results of the nocebo effect, i.e. they are not caused by the vaccination, but by negative expectations of the vaccinated person due to widespread fear stories!</p></a>
<a id="S353" spellcheck><h2>Heart muscle inflammation also infection</h2>
<p>Myocarditis is also caused by infection with Covid. Such a diagnosis can therefore also result from a previous Corona infection and does not have to be a vaccination side effect.</p></a>
<a id="S354" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects at-risk patients</h2>
<p>The collective vaccination of the population makes sense because it protects patients at risk who cannot vaccinate themselves. This small act of consideration is not too much to ask!</p></a>
<a id="S355" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination strengthens the immune system</h2>
<p>Vaccination is currently the best way to prepare one's immune system for pathogens and thus to strengthen it. In contrast, trying to strengthen one's immune system by going through an illness is a strategy that makes little sense.</p></a>
<a id="S356" spellcheck><h2>Diseases weaken the immune system</h2>
<p>Diseases, especially covid, weaken the immune system instead of strengthening it, contrary to common belief. They should therefore be avoided, for example by getting vaccinated against them.</p></a>
<a id="S357" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is mandatory in health care</h2>
<p>For employees who work in the health care sector, a vaccination obligation is being introduced worldwide, and quite rightly so. This is a very clear protective measure out of responsibility for patients.</p></a>
<a id="S358" spellcheck><h2>Overcome needle phobia!</h2>
<p>Many unvaccinated people are dealing with irrational fears from their childhood. They should overcome their doctor phobia or even their needle phobia to get us all out of this mess.</p></a>
<a id="S359" spellcheck><h2>PIMS risk for children high</h2>
<p>For children in particular, the risk of contracting MIS/PIMS after contracting Corona is very high. So in addition to protection of others, self-protection is also a good reason to vaccinate children.</p></a>
<a id="S360" spellcheck><h2>There are so beautiful masks</h2>
<p>In the meantime, there are so many beautiful motifs and colors for the medical masks, just like in the beginning with the fabric masks. So your own safety must be so at least no longer an aesthetic problem.</p></a>
<a id="S361" spellcheck><h2>Already used to masks</h2>
<p>I have become accustomed to the masks in recent years and feel comfortable with them. Therefore, I will probably continue to use this protection after the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S362" spellcheck><h2>No lipstick needed because of masks</h2>
<p>I like the masks because you have to invest less effort in make up and lipstick and can generally hide yourself and your flaws behind it. So the masks have like so like everything also a good side.</p></a>
<a id="S363" spellcheck><h2>Booster is valid indefinitely</h2>
<p>Despite the technical certificate validity of twelve months, the booster booster vaccination is valid indefinitely. One should not be put off by the whispers about a lifetime vaccination subscription.</p></a>
<a id="S364" spellcheck><h2>Normal signs of aging</h2>
<p>Physical problems that many people consider to be side effects of vaccination are actually normal symptoms of aging. They give a distorted picture of perceived side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S365" spellcheck><h2>For research Corona was good</h2>
<p>The pandemic has decisively advanced new technologies for disease treatment such as mRNA vaccines. We will benefit from this for many other diseases in the future.</p></a>
<a id="S366" spellcheck><h2>More cancer is pandemic consequence</h2>
<p>The increasing number of cancer cases is a result of the pandemic, as fewer people go for screening, surgeries and treatments are postponed, and follow-up care suffers as well. The cancer has nothing to do with the vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S367" spellcheck><h2>Risks higher for the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>The risks in terms of disease and disease progression are demonstrably higher for the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated. This is another reason why it is irrational to refuse vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S368" spellcheck><h2>Silent Triage</h2>
<p>Direct triage is rare in hospitals, but due to the pandemic, silent triage has long been taking place for other conditions such as cancer. This is another reason why the pandemic urgently needs to be overcome.</p></a>
<a id="S369" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination refusal often childhood trauma</h2>
<p>The rejection of vaccination by many people is not rationally justified, but is due to childhood traumas. However, global health security cannot be made dependent on such individual characteristics.</p></a>
<a id="S370" spellcheck><h2>Omicron mainly affects unvaccinated people</h2>
<p>Although the omicron variant is more contagious and less dangerous, it primarily affects the unvaccinated. These are therefore partly responsible for the fact that we must continue to protect our healthcare system through measures taken by all.</p></a>
<a id="S371" spellcheck><h2>Not to be taken seriously because of other areas</h2>
<p>I can't take you or certain critics' voices on Corona seriously, because they are already completely off the mark in other areas, e.g. climate change or the gender issue.</p></a>
<a id="S372" spellcheck><h2>Do not be of the same opinion as...</h2>
<p>You can't seriously be of the same opinion as person XY because you don't want to have anything in common with this person. That is a logically understandable reason for a rejection.</p></a>
<a id="S373" spellcheck><h2>You know the truth, but experts don't?</h2>
<p>Do you really think that you, as a layman, know the truth better than the majority of experts worldwide? That is already quite a presumption, more humility would be appropriate here.</p></a>
<a id="S374" spellcheck><h2>Will get vaccinated against everything</h2>
<p>For me, the Corona vaccination is a natural choice, as I am very successful in basically accepting all opportunities for vaccination and disease prevention.</p></a>
<a id="S375" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects children from MIS/PIMS</h2>
<p>Vaccination protects children not only from severe courses, but also from the covid aftereffects of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in organs such as the skin, heart, gastrointestinal tract, mucous membranes, lungs, liver, and kidneys.</p></a>
<a id="S376" spellcheck><h2>Pandemic of violence</h2>
<p>Aggressive mask refusers and vaccination opponents pose a daily risk to those who must sacrifice themselves and enforce Corona rules. Thousands of injuries and deaths worldwide show who is the aggressor.</p></a>
<a id="S377" spellcheck><h2>Canadian truckers danger for all</h2>
<p>The trucker protest in Canada represents only a small minority in relation to the total population. The country must not allow this minority to hold its supply and delivery structures to ransom.</p></a>
<a id="S378" spellcheck><h2>Novavax is the alternative</h2>
<p>Those who refuse vaccination because of the novel mRNA technology now have an alternative classical vaccine available in the form of Novavax. This means that there is no longer any reason to refuse vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S379" spellcheck><h2>State capitulates to those willing to be vaccinated</h2>
<p>If those willing to vaccinate manage to escape the appeals and restrictions, the state will have given up in the fight against the pandemic. If rules are hardly controlled or revoked by courts, this will pay off in the end.</p></a>
<a id="S380" spellcheck><h2>More and more vaccination opponents decide to</h2>
<p>More and more opponents of vaccination are now deciding in favor of vaccination for a variety of reasons. We should follow their example and provide ourselves with effective protection.</p></a>
<a id="S381" spellcheck><h2>First crisis experience for many</h2>
<p>For many, the pandemic is the first time they have experienced a crisis in society as a whole. For some, it is the first time they have had the unpleasant experience that there are events that neither a leading state nor they themselves can control so easily.</p></a>
<a id="S382" spellcheck><h2>Critics are spoiled by affluence</h2>
<p>Many who rebel against the pandemic policy are only spoiled by their previous, self-determined lives. They do not see that the changes are due to necessary hygiene and disease control.</p></a>
<a id="S383" spellcheck><h2>Leaving the ground of rationality</h2>
<p>Constructive debate is no longer possible with the majority of critics because of their positions. The prerequisite for a discourse would be to first return to a rational discussion.</p></a>
<a id="S384" spellcheck><h2>Resistance is selfish theater</h2>
<p>The majority of people act rationally, the resistance against the pandemic policy, on the other hand, is only a selfish theater of a minority. This minority has only elevated the whole thing to a fight for freedom.</p></a>
<a id="S385" spellcheck><h2>Resistance is pent-up frustration</h2>
<p>For many critics, the crisis was only the trigger for releasing personally pent-up frustration, which, however, has other, private and social causes. In resistance, one can now finally release this frustration.</p></a>
<a id="S386" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination is not a guarantee</h2>
<p>Nothing has ever been guaranteed with any vaccination. It is always only a matter of improving chances and probabilities. Perfect effectiveness exists only in theory.</p></a>
<a id="S387" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated have done their duty</h2>
<p>Those who have had themselves vaccinated have done their social duty. Now the opponents of vaccination must follow suit if they want to continue to claim their social rights.</p></a>
<a id="S388" spellcheck><h2>Feelings are not facts</h2>
<p>Critics of the pandemic policy base many of their views on feelings rather than facts. Political or journalistic balance is difficult when one side sticks to facts and the other to feelings.</p></a>
<a id="S389" spellcheck><h2>Lifetime stolen by the unvaccinated</h2>
<p>I was stolen a part of my lifetime by the unwillingness of the unvaccinated and the consideration of the policy on it. And now I want it back again!</p></a>
<a id="S390" spellcheck><h2>Hygiene is the basis of civilization</h2>
<p>Hygiene has brought mankind to where it is now against many problems. The hygiene measures in the crisis will also now bring us out of a major problem.</p></a>
<a id="S391" spellcheck><h2>Physical integrity abused</h2>
<p>The principle of physical integrity is appropriated by the critics against vaccination - from where it is really existential. In the process, the integrity of those infected is always ignored.</p></a>
<a id="S392" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated fall for quacks</h2>
<p>Many unvaccinated people think they can achieve a level of protection equivalent to vaccination by strengthening their immune system. In doing so, they fall for all sorts of recommendations from quacks.</p></a>
<a id="S393" spellcheck><h2>Social cohesion is lacking</h2>
<p>Cohesion in this country is broken in the long run. Personally, I have a hard time sitting down at a table with people who let themselves be taken over by right-wingers, who have crazy theories, and who lack solidarity.</p></a>
<a id="S394" spellcheck><h2>Acceptance of scientific findings</h2>
<p>The scientific consensus has a higher value than opinions and interpretations. With the reference to freedom of opinion, no aberrant nonsense may be sold as science.</p></a>
<a id="S395" spellcheck><h2>Elimination of masks would bring deaths</h2>
<p>If the mask requirement is withdrawn, we must expect thousands of additional deaths. Among them, especially vaccinated risk patients and those who are not allowed or not able to be vaccinated through no fault of their own.</p></a>
<a id="S396" spellcheck><h2>Too much emphasis on rights</h2>
<p>Critics place the emphasis in their arguments on individual rights and too little on obligations to the community. Rights and duties, however, must always be balanced.</p></a>
<a id="S397" spellcheck><h2>Corona does not go away from talking</h2>
<p>Critics should realize that corona is a medical problem, not a sociological one. UEs Will not go away from talking and listening, but only through massive and targeted government action.</p></a>
<a id="S398" spellcheck><h2>Older generation disappointed</h2>
<p>The older generation, to whom we owe a great deal, is experiencing a great deal of disappointment with the conduct of the 'I'm against everything' faction. In the crisis, respect for old age has been lost among some.</p></a>
<a id="S399" spellcheck><h2>Corona can kill the unborn</h2>
<p>Pregnant women wait for the birth out of fear of harming the unborn child before getting vaccinated. This is not only demonstrably unfounded but also potentially life-threatening for the unborn child.</p></a>
<a id="S400" spellcheck><h2>Comparison of victim numbers is clear</h2>
<p>Corona kills and vaccination helps to reduce this danger massively. The comparison of how many people have died worldwide from corona and from vaccination makes any discussion about what is right and what is wrong unnecessary.</p></a>
<a id="S401" spellcheck><h2>It depends on the virus evolution</h2>
<p>The fate of all of us will depend on the evolution of the coronavirus in the next few years. If it brings significantly fewer disease-causing variants to predominance, we will be out of the pandemic!</p></a>
<a id="S402" spellcheck><h2>Not vaccinating is endangering child welfare</h2>
<p>Depriving one's own children of vaccination is a dangerous act that society should not tolerate. The state should use its means to take action against parents for endangering the welfare of children.</p></a>
<a id="S403" spellcheck><h2>There is no split</h2>
<p>There is no division in the population. Only a few confused people are facing a large majority of reasonable people who are dealing with each other objectively, on a reasonable democratic basis.</p></a>
<a id="S404" spellcheck><h2>Individuals do not behave reasonably</h2>
<p>I am well informed through my media, and do not need links or information on the Corona topic. I also take great care to read only well-documented information from trustworthy media.</p></a>
<a id="S405" spellcheck><h2>Still infected shortly before vaccination</h2>
<p>Many people who fall ill or even die shortly after their vaccination or booster have simply been vaccinated or boosted too late - and thus became infected shortly before their vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S406" spellcheck><h2>Individuals do not behave reasonably</h2>
<p>We should abandon the idea that individuals behave rationally. Instead of following this wishful thinking, the state would do better to relieve individuals of decisions that are important for the community.</p></a>
<a id="S407" spellcheck><h2>Is like ignoring red lights</h2>
<p>Those who see controls and tests as state coercion also ignore red traffic lights, since the state only prevents you from driving quickly with them. They are not needed anyway, if everyone pays attention.</p></a>
<a id="S408" spellcheck><h2>He is also just an employee</h2>
<p>Those who enforce measures in the corporate sector, such as in restaurants, are just employees who have to do it. You don't seriously want them to lose their jobs because of their own refusal.</p></a>
<a id="S409" spellcheck><h2>Get small business owners in trouble</h2>
<p>By refusing measures such as masks, you only get those who have to enforce them into trouble. As a rule, these are small businesses that are not responsible for any of this.</p></a>
<a id="S410" spellcheck><h2>In this case totally understandable</h2>
<p>In this particular situation - queue, buffet, etc.. - it is totally understandable if people have to wear masks. One should have prescribed this also always, in order to protect us all against pathogens of others.</p></a>
<a id="S411" spellcheck><h2>Inconsiderate to the elderly</h2>
<p>By refusing to take measures, one behaves recklessly and, in the worst case, is even directly or indirectly responsible for the death of elderly or immunocompromised people. Nobody can want that!</p></a>
<a id="S412" spellcheck><h2>Everything is already strongly loosened</h2>
<p>Politicians have long since reduced the measures to a barely noticeable level so that we can all live as comfortably as possible. The remaining rules are really no reason to rebel.</p></a>
<a id="S413" spellcheck><h2>This is good for humanity</h2>
<p>It is also good for mankind to be slowed down by the Corona crisis. It should be taken as an impetus to stop the overexploitation of nature and to start a sustainable economy.</p></a>
<a id="S414" spellcheck><h2>Doctors vaccinate their own children</h2>
<p>A large part of the doctors vaccinates not only themselves but also their own children against Corona before the release. So you can really assume a meaningful protection with the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S415" spellcheck><h2>We have much bigger problems</h2>
<p>We humans have much bigger problems than Corona, e.g. climate change, wars, etc. So one should not demonstrate against harmless Corona measures but instead for the solution of these big problems.</p></a>
<a id="S416" spellcheck><h2>Does not want conflicts</h2>
<p>I go along with the measures like wearing masks mainly to avoid conflicts with other people. That way, it's much easier to get through the crisis.</p></a>
<a id="S417" spellcheck><h2>Does not want to be registered by the state</h2>
<p>I am also critical of one or the other element of Corona's policy, but I prefer to stay under the radar to avoid being registered by the state.</p></a>
<a id="S418" spellcheck><h2>Anti-vaxxers devalue everything</h2>
<p>The general opposition to any vaccination, whose representatives mingle among the protests, completely devalues the justified criticism of measures. One should not take to the streets together with them.</p></a>
<a id="S419" spellcheck><h2>Already gives compulsory vaccinations</h2>
<p>Compulsory vaccination against Corona is not special, as there have been compulsory vaccinations for a long time. This obligation is usually well justified with the risk and the danger of the disease.</p></a>
<a id="S420" spellcheck><h2>Is bad for all of us</h2>
<p>Those who complain about their own existential limitations due to the measures should realize that everyone has to cut back - and we can only get out of the crisis together.</p></a>
<a id="S421" spellcheck><h2>The children do so beautifully</h2>
<p>The children help nevertheless so beautifully in the schools and kindergartens with the many solidary measures like masks and distances to master the crisis. There one can still have hope for the future of mankind.</p></a>
<a id="S422" spellcheck><h2>Uses right vocabulary</h2>
<p>By using politically right-wing vocabulary such as 'mainstream media' or 'puppets', one makes oneself mean and untrustworthy with their views. One can also criticize without such references.</p></a>
<a id="S423" spellcheck><h2>Personalization of capitalist relations</h2>
<p>Holding people like Uğur Şahin or Bill Gates personally responsible for exploiting the crisis is just a deliberate personalization of the system. In this way, nothing changes in the capitalist relations.</p></a>
<a id="S424" spellcheck><h2>To make fear was right</h2>
<p>Politicians did scare the population in many places during the crisis, but this approach was the right one. Without such campaigns, people simply would not have taken the crisis seriously.</p></a>
<a id="S425" spellcheck><h2>Omikron BA.2 variant</h2>
<p>The omicron variant BA.2 has a fitness advantage and is therefore even more contagious than the original variant. We will probably have to ward them off for a longer time through targeted measures.</p></a>
<a id="S426" spellcheck><h2>Children have lost parents</h2>
<p>Many children worldwide have lost their parents to Corona and are now on their own. Corona measures are there precisely to prevent such suffering by acting in solidarity.</p></a>
<a id="S427" spellcheck><h2>Children contagious without sypmtoms</h2>
<p>Children regularly have the highest incidence levels and can thus become super-spreaders completely without symptoms. Therefore, tests and masks in schools and kindergartens are sensible protective measures.</p></a>
<a id="S428" spellcheck><h2>Corona can shrink the brain</h2>
<p>Covid infection can result in brain damage. In particular, the gray matter responsible for emotions and memory shrinks, and the sense of smell can also suffer permanent damage.</p></a>
<a id="S429" spellcheck><h2>In previous epidemics, the vaccine would have been welcomed</h2>
<p>In past epidemics and pandemics, such as the Spanish flu, people would have welcomed having an effective vaccine. Today, they are simply behaving irrationally when they reject one.</p></a>
<a id="S430" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated have higher viral load</h2>
<p>Segregation and unequal treatment of the unvaccinated is justified because they have a higher viral load when they fall ill. They are simply more contagious and thus more dangerous for their fellow human beings than vaccinated persons.</p></a>
<a id="S431" spellcheck><h2>Belief in conventional medicine</h2>
<p>When it comes to Corona, I have complete faith in conventional medicine. It simply gives you a good feeling to be treated in case of illness by someone who has gone to 'school', i.e. has been properly trained.</p></a>
<a id="S432" spellcheck><h2>Alternative media are like alternative medicine</h2>
<p>Alternative media relate to established media somewhat like alternative medicine to conventional medicine. Alternative media can therefore not be taken seriously, just as homeopathy is not taken seriously.</p></a>
<a id="S433" spellcheck><h2>Recombinant threatens</h2>
<p>We are threatened by a viral recombinant of a dangerous and a contagious variant, which may lead to a crisis of even greater proportions. We should therefore be careful and not become lax in our protective measures.</p></a>
<a id="S434" spellcheck><h2>Without measures, there is a risk of contamination</h2>
<p>The omission of measures such as mandatory masks always carries the risk that the virus will spread to large parts of the population. Then we would have a contagion, which no one can seriously want.</p></a>
<a id="S435" spellcheck><h2>You can not fool so many people</h2>
<p>The thesis that we are all being led around by the nose with the virus is simply not comprehensible. It is completely unrealistic that so many people can be deceived in this way.</p></a>
<a id="S436" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to jeopardize my vacation</h2>
<p>I am vaccinated, but I still avoid parties and wear a mask as often as possible so as not to endanger my upcoming vacation. A single positive test can already throw a spanner in the works.</p></a>
<a id="S437" spellcheck><h2>If you would only obey, we would all be free</h2>
<p>Those who oppose prescriptions and vaccinations are to blame for the situation not improving. If they obeyed, we would have overcome the crisis long ago and would be free again.</p></a>
<a id="S438" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination not directly responsible</h2>
<p>In people who suffer damage after vaccination, the cause is not the vaccination itself, but existing and undetected previous diseases. Often, an undetected corona infection is also the reason.</p></a>
<a id="S439" spellcheck><h2>Do not want to lose my job</h2>
<p>I don't agree with a lot of it either, but I can't help but follow the guidelines because I fear for my job. Not everyone can afford to take a critical stance.</p></a>
<a id="S440" spellcheck><h2>I only follow my instructions</h2>
<p>In my professional role, I cannot help but follow instructions from my employer or supervisor. Therefore, I cannot be held responsible for possible consequences and problems.</p></a>
<a id="S441" spellcheck><h2>You do not know with many things what is in it</h2>
<p>Lack of knowledge about ingredients does not only apply to vaccines. In general, no one can say with certainty what is contained in the foods and medications we consume every day.</p></a>
<a id="S442" spellcheck><h2>Bogus correlation due to lack of data</h2>
<p>Although mortality rates are partially correlated with vaccination rates, this correlation is only a spurious correlation. The available data cannot answer whether vaccinations have a positive or negative effect on deaths.</p></a>
<a id="S443" spellcheck><h2>Does not give more heart attacks after vaccination</h2>
<p>Statistically, the number of heart attacks has not increased. Claims that vaccination leads to increased heart problems and infarctions are not supported by the numbers.</p></a>
<a id="S444" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality has other causes</h2>
<p>There are most likely other causes than the vaccination campaign for the excess mortality observed worldwide, such as the failure to treat many chronic diseases. Such false claims only put us all at risk.</p></a>
<a id="S445" spellcheck><h2>Vaccine does not destroy the immune system</h2>
<p>The assertion that the immune system is destroyed by vaccination is a dangerous misstatement that is not supported by any evidence. It makes people abandon the life-saving vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S446" spellcheck><h2>No underreporting of vaccine injuries/deaths</h2>
<p>A claimed high number of unreported cases of vaccination injuries and deaths is not supported by any evidence. Based on the existing reporting and backup procedures, it can be assumed that the majority of cases are reported correctly.</p></a>
<a id="S447" spellcheck><h2>Was already sick before vaccination</h2>
<p>People who fall ill with covid or other diseases after vaccination were often already ill before vaccination. In their case, it is not the vaccine side effects that are responsible, the disease would have broken out anyway.</p></a>
<a id="S448" spellcheck><h2>Omicron is other kind of danger</h2>
<p>With Omikron, the ratio of incidences to deaths is different, because it is less dangerous and much more contagious. However, this only means that the danger is different, not that it has been eliminated.</p></a>
<a id="S449" spellcheck><h2>Omicron vaccine takes too long</h2>
<p>It will simply take too long before a specific vaccine for the Omikron variant is ready for development. Until then, we are only protected with a vaccine that is not very effective, so caution is still the order of the day.</p></a>
<a id="S450" spellcheck><h2>Deltacron-Variant</h2>
<p>A new variant of the virus is spreading that combines the dangerousness of the Delta variant with the high rate of spread of the Omicron variant. Measures must again be taken against the spread of this variant.</p></a>
<a id="S451" spellcheck><h2>How many are still protected?</h2>
<p>Due to the decreasing effectiveness of vaccination and the many breakthroughs, it is not yet known how many of those vaccinated are still adequately protected. Unfortunately, the vaccination rate does not provide any precise information on this.</p></a>
<a id="S452" spellcheck><h2>Covid should scare you more</h2>
<p>It is irrational to avoid vaccination out of concern for side effects, since the disease with its long-term consequences is much more likely. One should be more concerned about the disease than the risk of a vaccination side effect.</p></a>
<a id="S453" spellcheck><h2>Long Covid victims are not taken seriously</h2>
<p>Many physicians and policymakers dismiss common Long Covid symptoms such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as imaginary or not Covid-related. In this way, they try to distract from their risky easing policies.</p></a>
<a id="S454" spellcheck><h2>Teasing someone about the mask is bullying</h2>
<p>People who continue to wear masks out of concern for their health despite the suspended mask requirement must be respected at all costs. Any kind of exclusion or disparagement of these people is bullying!</p></a>
<a id="S455" spellcheck><h2>If from the lab, then an accident</h2>
<p>If the laboratory origin of the virus was confirmed, its escape was almost certainly accidental and not a conspiracy. A deliberately released pest would have been much more deadly and sophisticated.</p></a>
<a id="S456" spellcheck><h2>Wearing masks gives safety</h2>
<p>Wearing masks gives people security and leads to lower psychological stress because people feel protected and thus have less fear of infection. Masks thus also indirectly ensure better health for everyone.</p></a>
<a id="S457" spellcheck><h2>Rare allergic reactions treatable</h2>
<p>The vaccination can cause an allergic reaction in rare cases, but this is easily treatable with an epipen. There is no reason to dismiss people from vaccination with reference to this risk.</p></a>
<a id="S458" spellcheck><h2>Sick vaccinated only had bad luck</h2>
<p>People who got sick covid despite the vaccination, just had bad luck. Such vaccine breakthroughs are possible, for example, due to individually less effective vaccination, but the fate of very few people.</p></a>
<a id="S459" spellcheck><h2>Healthy unvaccinated people were just lucky</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated persons who were spared infection or had only a mild course were simply lucky. No statement about the effectiveness of the vaccination can be derived from the existence of this group.</p></a>
<a id="S460" spellcheck><h2>The Science is unequivocal</h2>
<p>The science around corona control is clear and unequivocal. Therefore, there is no acceptable reason to doubt or avoid global vaccination as a key pandemic control measure.</p></a>
<a id="S461" spellcheck><h2>Bill Gates is also vaccinated</h2>
<p>Bill Gates, whom some see as the mastermind of a great Corona conspiracy, is himself vaccinated. He would not have himself and his children vaccinated if the vaccination represented what the critics claim.</p></a>
<a id="S462" spellcheck><h2>Virus forces the measures</h2>
<p>The virus in its spreading pattern simply forces measures such as lockdowns once a certain number of cases have been identified. Politicians, advised by experts, do nothing other than counteract this by imposing restrictions.</p></a>
<a id="S463" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination critics see vaccination damage everywhere</h2>
<p>In their assumption that vaccination makes people ill, vaccination critics interpret every event and symptom in their vaccinated environment as vaccine damage. In doing so, they completely disregard the fact that people always get sick sometimes.</p></a>
<a id="S464" spellcheck><h2>Continue to wear the mask in solidarity</h2>
<p>Even though the mask is no longer mandatory, I will continue to wear it to show solidarity. If even one person is spared from the fate of Covid in this way, the effort has already been worthwhile.</p></a>
<a id="S465" spellcheck><h2>Some have it in the genes</h2>
<p>If some people simply don't get infected or get covid, it's because of their good genetic makeup. However, one cannot assume that such a positive fate is given to all people.</p></a>
<a id="S466" spellcheck><h2>No effect without side effect</h2>
<p>With medicines, there are side effects, because what has no side effects has no effect. Therefore, the indignation of vaccinated people about their little problems is misplaced in the face of our great challenges.</p></a>
<a id="S467" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination saves millions of lives</h2>
<p>Vaccination has saved millions of lives worldwide and continues to save some, with a very small number of vaccine injuries. We continue to prevent almost all fatal outcomes by providing the vaccines.</p></a>
<a id="S468" spellcheck><h2>Shall rejoice in freedom of expression</h2>
<p>Anyone who now publishes and discusses the most outlandish theses in social media should be happy about this form of freedom of speech. However, free speech also means having to accept equally loud opposition.</p></a>
<a id="S469" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are (mini-)long covid</h2>
<p>What critics call side effects of vaccination are actually symptoms of mini Long Covid disease. Minor Long Covid symptoms can also develop after undetected or mild courses.</p></a>
<a id="S470" spellcheck><h2>Errors in vaccination campaigns</h2>
<p>Policymakers around the world have made many mistakes in distributing and rolling out vaccines, which have cost unnecessary casualties. To avoid repeating these mistakes, vaccination campaigns must be better organized in the future.</p></a>
<a id="S471" spellcheck><h2>Spike protein is not the whole virus</h2>
<p>Only a complete virus can force human cells to reproduce. In contrast, mRNA vaccination only ensures the production of harmless spike proteins, which themselves only activate the immune system and do not 'hijack' cells.</p></a>
<a id="S472" spellcheck><h2>Snippet mRNA is harmless</h2>
<p>The mRNA blueprint introduced into the body's cells via inoculation should not be scary because it only contains instructions for producing small spike proteins, not a full virus.</p></a>
<a id="S473" spellcheck><h2>A viral infection proceeds exponentially</h2>
<p>Vaccination is preferable to natural infection because viral infection means an exponentially growing glut of viruses that the immune system must fight off, but the vaccine does not take exponential development.</p></a>
<a id="S474" spellcheck><h2>Booster vaccine is withheld</h2>
<p>Because the vaccination effect wears off faster than desired, everyone should have access to timely booster vaccinations. While there is enough vaccine, it is unfortunately not yet made available for regular booster vaccinations.</p></a>
<a id="S475" spellcheck><h2>Critical studies usually unserious</h2>
<p>Studies critical of measures and vaccines are usually interest-driven and thus highly dubious. In this way, opponents of vaccination repeatedly try to give a scientific veneer to aberrant views.</p></a>
<a id="S476" spellcheck><h2>Individual cases are not representative</h2>
<p>Frequently cited anecdotal individual fates of vaccination side effects or even deaths are irrelevant, even if it is one's own fate. Only statistically clean surveys and evaluations can provide reliable data.</p></a>
<a id="S477" spellcheck><h2>Expert conspiracy unrealistic</h2>
<p>It is unrealistic that millions of experts of all relevant disciplines from partly hostile countries have conspired with each other to form Corona. Someone who believes this is hard to take seriously.</p></a>
<a id="S478" spellcheck><h2>People can not handle information</h2>
<p>The majority of people cannot cope with the amount of information and cannot classify the published figures. They now react to critical media reports with mistrust, but used to fully trust their doctor.</p></a>
<a id="S479" spellcheck><h2>Prepare for the next winter</h2>
<p>The next winter with a winter wave is coming in any case and we have to prepare for it better than before. Disease and death are best prevented by early vaccination and boosting - also of children.</p></a>
<a id="S480" spellcheck><h2>"Since" is not the same as &lsquo;because&rsquo;!</h2>
<p>It is true that 'since' is not the same as 'because', i.e. corellation is not causality. In individual cases, it is very difficult to decide whether a supposed side effect is coincidental or causally related to the vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S481" spellcheck><h2>All self-proclaimed experts</h2>
<p>Surveys repeatedly reveal a clear tendency to overestimate oneself, for example when a large majority considers itself to be of above-average intelligence. Of course, this is just as true for virological questions.</p></a>
<a id="S482" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination victims would also have fallen ill in the same way</h2>
<p>Anyone who has an allegedly life-threatening reaction to even a weak 'viral dose' of a vaccination would probably have become seriously ill in the event of an infection even without vaccination. Individual weakness must not be blamed on vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S483" spellcheck><h2>Side effects are normal with new drugs</h2>
<p>New drugs often still show side effects, but these are gradually improved via further development of the vaccine. Side effects were unavoidable in this case in order to react quickly to the spread of the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S484" spellcheck><h2>Severity of the side effect subjective</h2>
<p>The term 'serious side effect' is defined objectively in scientific terms, but subjectively everyone understands it differently (e.g. a sore arm). This drives up the recorded side effect figures.</p></a>
<a id="S485" spellcheck><h2>Doctors are obliged to report!</h2>
<p>Physicians are required by law to report even the suspicion of harm beyond the usual extent of a vaccination reaction. They therefore do so even in the absence of a financial incentive.</p></a>
<a id="S486" spellcheck><h2>There is sufficient open discourse</h2>
<p>The Internet and media provide sufficient platforms for open discourse on vaccination and measures. To be taken seriously in this ager, more than an expression of opinion on false facts is required.</p></a>
<a id="S487" spellcheck><h2>You can also report side effects yourself</h2>
<p>Complaints that physicians do not report side effects to their patients can easily be offset by those affected making their own reports online. All that is needed is to make use of this option.</p></a>
<a id="S488" spellcheck><h2>People believe charlatans</h2>
<p>There is a multitude of charlatans who are also up to their mischief in the Corona environment. No matter how often they have been disproved, there are always people who believe them more than real doctors and scientists.</p></a>
<a id="S489" spellcheck><h2>Facts do not help against diffuse fears</h2>
<p>One of the difficulties with opponents of vaccination is that facts do not help against diffuse fears. Despite many information campaigns on vaccination, the fear of vaccination and imagined consequences will probably never be completely conquered.</p></a>
<a id="S490" spellcheck><h2>Environmental degradation and pandemics</h2>
<p>Viral diversity in animals is always looking for new hosts - Corona has succeeded in making the leap to humans. Every intervention in nature increases the risk of new pandemics, for example when wild animals come into contact with farm animals.</p></a>
<a id="S491" spellcheck><h2>0.6 vs. 0.5 percent in control group</h2>
<p>Critics often cite the 0.6% serious health problems from the Pfizer pivotal study, but usually fail to mention that 0.5% serious health problems also occurred in the control group.</p></a>
<a id="S492" spellcheck><h2>Alleged Schwab quote is not one</h2>
<p>The quote "You will own nothing and be happy." is wrongly attributed to Klaus Schwab, but it actually comes from a Danish politician who used it years ago to describe an extreme vision of the "share economy" for the WEF.</p></a>
<a id="S493" spellcheck><h2>Monkey pox shows pandemic threat</h2>
<p>The current outbreak of monkeypox, although less dangerous, nevertheless shows the pandemic threat we all face. It is high time that experts worldwide agree on international pandemic protection mechanisms.</p></a>
<a id="S494" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination bias</h2>
<p>On closer investigation, many experts who are critical of vaccination are close to a clientele that has always been positioned against vaccination. Therefore, their arguments in favor of vaccination should be taken with a grain of salt.</p></a>
<a id="S495" spellcheck><h2>BA.5-Variant in Portugal</h2>
<p>In Portugal, the new Omicron variant BA.5 was able to spread because many Corona measures were lifted too early. Policymakers in other countries should learn from this effect and better maintain their measures.</p></a>
<a id="S496" spellcheck><h2>Does not want monkey pox</h2>
<p>I have no desire to be infected with monkeypox, so I expect politicians to act faster and better than before in the event of a new pandemic. And hopefully they will use the Corona experience to do so.</p></a>
<a id="S497" spellcheck><h2>Media prefer negative reports</h2>
<p>The media typically prefer negative and sensational news, as this serves to attract attention and thus their revenues. From this fact, however, one cannot deduce a controlled fear manipulation of the masses in the pandemic context.</p></a>
<a id="S498" spellcheck><h2>Chain of infection in monkeypox unclear</h2>
<p>In monkeypox, the chain of infection is usually traceable, but this is not the case with the current infections. There is a worrying possibility that the virus has changed its transmission characteristics.</p></a>
<a id="S499" spellcheck><h2>Charlatans are dangerous</h2>
<p>In the corona context, as in other areas, dangerous charlatans are active who promise victims success with alternative treatment methods. It is in the interest of the general public that the state puts a stop to them.</p></a>
<a id="S500" spellcheck><h2>Who are &lsquo;them up there&rsquo;?</h2>
<p>Who are the ominous elites that have engineered this entire crisis and are controlling it from above? Anyone who speaks of central actors without being able to name them makes himself untrustworthy.</p></a>
<a id="S501" spellcheck><h2>What about North Korea?</h2>
<p>How can one explain the catastrophic Corona outbreak in North Korea, whose government has so far refused vaccinations? The country's situation shows that isolation alone is not enough to contain the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S502" spellcheck><h2>No mass psychosis</h2>
<p>The crisis is not a mass psychosis or 'formation'. Pseudo experts misused terms from psychology here. Such critics must not be given publicity.</p></a>
<a id="S503" spellcheck><h2>Virus is imported again through travel</h2>
<p>Although the virus situation is improving in the home country, the virus is imported again and again in new variants due to increasing worldwide travel. Politics must take the lead here through regulations.</p></a>
<a id="S504" spellcheck><h2>SADS has always existed</h2>
<p>The diagnosis of sudden, unexplained cardiac death has been around for a long time and has nothing to do with the current Corona situation or the vaccination campaigns. Corresponding claims with reference to statistical figures are misinformation.</p></a>
<a id="S505" spellcheck><h2>Algorithms make extremists</h2>
<p>Social media algorithms, typically designed to hold people, bring them into contact with increasingly extreme views in the Corona context. In the end, you end up irredeemably in the Telegram bubble.</p></a>
<a id="S506" spellcheck><h2>Firmware update for the immune system</h2>
<p>You can look at vaccinations like a firmware update for the immune system. If the old one still has errors, you simply add a new update with a booster and at some point everything works and the pandemic is overcome.</p></a>
<a id="S507" spellcheck><h2>Is due to heat and climate change</h2>
<p>Heart problems and infarctions can be explained by climate change, as excessive heat can overload the human body. Here, predisposed people who already carry certain heart disease risks become victims.</p></a>
<a id="S508" spellcheck><h2>Is due to dehydration</h2>
<p>Tromboses, heart problems, and heart attacks can often be explained by dehydration, as people typically do not drink enough. There are usually simpler explanations than claimed vaccine side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S509" spellcheck><h2>Is due to the psychological stress</h2>
<p>Heart problems and attacks in the pandemic era often have psychosomatic causes such as financial worries or additional stresses from home schooling. There are usually simpler explanations than claimed vaccine side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S510" spellcheck><h2>Is due to solar storms</h2>
<p>So-called solar storms, which occur in cycles, can not only cause technical malfunctions but also increase the risk of heart disease. This is another possible explanation for claimed vaccine side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S511" spellcheck><h2>Is due to pollution</h2>
<p>Pollution of air, water and soil is responsible for millions of deaths each year, manifesting as strokes, heart attacks or chronic heart disease. Some mistakenly see these as vaccine side effects.</p></a>
<a id="S512" spellcheck><h2>Virtually the same vaccine</h2>
<p>Vaccines adapted to new variants work according to the same procedure, only individual elements have been exchanged. Therefore, the abandonment of new licensing studies makes sense to get us out of the pandemic faster.</p></a>
<a id="S513" spellcheck><h2>Preference for hearsay</h2>
<p>Many people base their decisions on hearsay and second-hand information rather than on sound scientific data. This is not the way to get the dangerousness of the situation into people's heads via the media.</p></a>
<a id="S514" spellcheck><h2>Why critical here in particular?</h2>
<p>Hospital statistics showing high occupancy by multiple vaccinees are not evidence of ineffectiveness or harmfulness of vaccination, but rather an indication that there are many more vaccinated individuals in high-risk groups.</p></a>
<a id="S515" spellcheck><h2>With freedom comes responsibility</h2>
<p>With every freedom always comes a corresponding responsibility. The problem is that some people want one without the other, even though a balance between the two is the ideal for a society.</p></a>
<a id="S516" spellcheck><h2>Tested and proven</h2>
<p>Although the vaccines made available worldwide were developed and deployed in a very short time, it is now possible to infer from their successful use alone that they are tested and proven products.</p></a>
<a id="S517" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated in hospital unfair</h2>
<p>Not vaccinating yourself and then expecting the same care in case of illness as vaccinated people is unfair to the hospital staff. They are not only physically but also emotionally overburdened.</p></a>
<a id="S518" spellcheck><h2>Vaccinated less dangerous for others</h2>
<p>People who get vaccinated usually have only mild symptoms or none at all. Without symptoms, one has a lower viral load, hardly sneezes or coughs and thus hardly excretes the virus via aerosols or droplets.</p></a>
<a id="S519" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated do not live long enough for studies</h2>
<p>Studies showing overcrowding of hospitals with vaccinated individuals distort reality because unvaccinated individuals simply do not live long enough to still participate in this type of survey.</p></a>
<a id="S520" spellcheck><h2>Simply signs of age</h2>
<p>Difficulty climbing stairs and walking have nothing to do with vaccination (or Long Covid), but are simply an expected sign of aging. In old age, you can no longer expect so much from your body.</p></a>
<a id="S521" spellcheck><h2>Simply a matter of conscience</h2>
<p>My conscience simply won't allow me to violate distance, masking and social distancing rules. After all, you don't want to make your family, friends or people in general sick through negligent actions.</p></a>
<a id="S522" spellcheck><h2>Access to vaccines a privilege</h2>
<p>Early access to tested vaccines adapted to current virus variants is a great privilege reserved mainly for developed countries. Unfortunately, this awareness is not present among many.</p></a>
<a id="S523" spellcheck><h2>Extremes lead to nothing good</h2>
<p>To strive for extremes, e.g. the complete freedom of the individual, always leads to a deterioration for a society. It is always a matter of rational considerations that take into account human emancipation and solidarity.</p></a>
<a id="S524" spellcheck><h2>Nuremberg Code abused</h2>
<p>Critics of mass vaccination falsely place it in the context of the Nuremberg Code as a forced mass medical experiment. There can be no question of this in the case of an urgently needed and extensively tested vaccine.</p></a>
<a id="S525" spellcheck><h2>False Balance Problem</h2>
<p>When mass media attempt to reflect a diversity of opinions, a false balance quickly develops in which viewpoints appear more relevant to readers than they are. This is particularly common among Corona critics.</p></a>
<a id="S526" spellcheck><h2>Abolish licensing bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Progress in medicines worldwide is being held back by a regulatory bureaucracy. The use of medicines should simply be left to the free market and individual choice.</p></a>
<a id="S527" spellcheck><h2>Safety rules are undermined</h2>
<p>Protective structures are being undermined by an increasingly lax approach to safety rules, for example in public transportation or air travel. This puts people in danger and can also provoke new waves of disease.</p></a>
<a id="S528" spellcheck><h2>More than a severe cold</h2>
<p>Coronavirus infection is often mistakenly equated by critics with a severe cold. However, this virus is more dangerous because it has been shown to be more than just a cold symptom.</p></a>
<a id="S529" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination reduces the risk of infection</h2>
<p>A current vaccination does not protect 100% against infection, but the risk of infection is significantly reduced. Therefore, it is very useful to keep your vaccination status up to date as long as virus variants are still circulating.</p></a>
<a id="S530" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination protects against severe courses</h2>
<p>You can get sick even with the vaccination and even end up in the hospital, but it protects against severe courses. Therefore, it is very useful to update your vaccination regularly.</p></a>
<a id="S531" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination reduces long covid risk</h2>
<p>Although it is possible to get sick enough with vaccination to retain long covid symptoms, the risk of this is significantly reduced with vaccination. Therefore, up-to-date vaccination is desirable.</p></a>
<a id="S532" spellcheck><h2>Omicron BQ.1.1</h2>
<p>A new Omikron variant BG.1.1 spreads quickly and is both contagious like Omikron and dangerous like the Delta variant. Therefore, there is no other option than to impose comprehensive protective measures again.</p></a>
<a id="S533" spellcheck><h2>Twindemic</h2>
<p>With the Corona pandemic, influenza also poses a greater threat, for which, fortunately, there are up-to-date vaccines. We are threatened in the worst case by a Twindemic in winter, in which both Corona and influenza are rampant.</p></a>
<a id="S534" spellcheck><h2>Studien-Cherrypicking</h2>
<p>Critics sometimes support their positions with convincing studies, but this is mainly due to the fact that they select the most suitable papers. A balanced scientific approach would lead to completely different results.</p></a>
<a id="S535" spellcheck><h2>Fortunately it was not Delta</h2>
<p>I am very happy that I did contract Corona, but only the less dangerous Omicron variant, not the Delta variant that was present in the beginning. The evolution of the virus saved me.</p></a>
<a id="S536" spellcheck><h2>Depression symptoms in many cases</h2>
<p>There is a correlation between Long Covid symptoms and depression. Symptoms of depression such as listlessness, fatigue or concentration problems are sometimes wrongly interpreted as late effects of a covid infection.</p></a>
<a id="S537" spellcheck><h2>More vaccinated people expected in hospital</h2>
<p>The seemingly unusually high proportion of vaccinated people with covid in the hospital is actually expected, since the old and previously ill were vaccinated at a higher rate and are naturally more likely to end up there as high-risk patients.</p></a>
<a id="S538" spellcheck><h2>From Corona denier to Putin fan</h2>
<p>Many critics have seamlessly taken their aggressive ignorance of reality from the Corona topic to the Ukraine topic, and now they are also getting into trouble here with deviant views. After the anti-mainstream, you can already set the clock.</p></a>
<a id="S539" spellcheck><h2>Mask less unpleasant than late effects</h2>
<p>Wearing a mask temporarily on public transport, for example, is far less unpleasant than the potentially lifelong, agonizing consequences of an infection. I simply don't understand why the critics are so reluctant.</p></a>
<a id="S540" spellcheck><h2>Boosters as a health routine</h2>
<p>If you don't find the prospect of difficulty concentrating, aching muscles, joints and limbs, faintness and shortness of breath attractive, you should go for a booster as soon as possible. And let this booster become a health routine.</p></a>
<a id="S541" spellcheck><h2>Standing before the era of pandemics</h2>
<p>There will soon be combinations of different viruses, and infection with them would probably result in a high death rate. The probability of this is so high that we are threatened with a whole era of pandemics.</p></a>
<a id="S542" spellcheck><h2>Sometimes glad about the mask requirement</h2>
<p>I am sometimes glad that there is a mask requirement in certain places, e.g. in narrow waiting rooms or crowded public transport. That way I don't have to argue with other people about mutual protection.</p></a>
<a id="S543" spellcheck><h2>I like to wear the mask</h2>
<p>I now like to wear the mask because it gives me the good feeling of protecting my loved ones. It is still a comparatively unproblematic and easy to implement protection compared to other measures.</p></a>
<a id="S544" spellcheck><h2>External protection is and was given</h2>
<p>Although third-party protection through vaccination was not scientifically investigated at the beginning of the campaign, it can now be assumed as proven based on practical experience. Critics only inflate this aspect.</p></a>
<a id="S545" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality is still pandemic</h2>
<p>The observed persistent global excess mortality can still be explained by the pandemic. In this case, people die from the longer-term after-effects of covid diseases that have already been overcome.</p></a>
<a id="S546" spellcheck><h2>There is no glory in prevention</h2>
<p>A preventive measure such as vaccination may not have any immediate benefit for the individual, but in its totality it helps the community. Unfortunately, this is difficult to communicate and many people are not understanding.</p></a>
<a id="S547" spellcheck><h2>Critics trigger fear and illness</h2>
<p>Critics who constantly bring up the very rare deaths and side effects of vaccinations trigger fears in their vaccinated communication partners that can themselves become pathological and trigger real illnesses!</p></a>
<a id="S548" spellcheck><h2>Any infection carries long covid risk</h2>
<p>In general, even after vaccination, any corona infection carries risks for long-term damage. Therefore, it makes sense to prevent infections. And thus also to maintain measures such as mandatory masks for a long time to come.</p></a>
<a id="S549" spellcheck><h2>Vaccination rate shows level of education</h2>
<p>The vaccination rate in a country or even a specific population group is a direct indicator of the educational level of the group. The higher it is, the more people have opted for vaccinations and also for boosters.</p></a>
<a id="S550" spellcheck><h2>Critics believe in voodoo</h2>
<p>During the pandemic, unfortunately, many people think they know better than science. They rely on treatment with substances and procedures that are more reminiscent of voodoo than sensible medical measures.</p></a>
<a id="S551" spellcheck><h2>There is no listening requirement</h2>
<p>Prominent critics complain about restricted freedom of speech because they do not appear in media reports or are not invited on talk shows. In doing so, they overlook the fact that freedom of speech by no means implies an obligation to listen.</p></a>
<a id="S552" spellcheck><h2>Hanlon's razor blade</h2>
<p>Even in the Corona context, Hanlon's razor blade usually applies, according to which one should never attribute to malice that which can also be adequately explained by stupidity.</p></a>
<a id="S553" spellcheck><h2>Spikes only for a short time</h2>
<p>The spike molecules are only produced in the body for a short time after the mRNA vaccine is injected, in order to stimulate the immune system to build antibodies. Side effects can therefore also only occur during this short period.</p></a>
<a id="S554" spellcheck><h2>Antibody therapies not at Omikron</h2>
<p>Preventive antibody therapies against coronavirus have little effect in Omikron. This is due to the progressive development of resistance to the virus, against which new forms of therapy must be researched.</p></a>
<a id="S555" spellcheck><h2>Baby boom and not birth slump</h2>
<p>The critics' claim that vaccination leads to infertility and thus to a decline in births has not been confirmed in many countries. Instead, a baby boom can even be observed in many places.</p></a>
<a id="S556" spellcheck><h2>CDS is corrosive and dangerous</h2>
<p>Chlorine dioxide solution (CDS), considered by many critics to be a miracle cure for treating infections, is actually dangerous. It can cause harm such as chemical burns, depending on how it is made or used.</p></a>
<a id="S557" spellcheck><h2>Sudden death not an issue in the past</h2>
<p>News about sudden deaths is spread only for self-affirmation or to generate clicks. There used to be such deaths too, but news about them just didn't get out to the public.</p></a>
<a id="S558" spellcheck><h2>Has nothing to do with vaccination</h2>
<p>The susceptibility of many people to disease can be traced back to an immune deficiency after having undergone corona infection. It therefore has nothing to do with vaccination, although this is repeatedly claimed.</p></a>
<a id="S559" spellcheck><h2>Trolls controlled from Russia</h2>
<p>The Russian government is generally interested in sabotaging and dividing Western societies with its propaganda. This also applies to the Corona issue, where a lot of misinformation is distributed through Russian channels.</p></a>
<a id="S560" spellcheck><h2>Unvaccinated split (themselves)</h2>
<p>People who refuse to be vaccinated are dividing society by splitting themselves off from the majority. In this respect, the narrative of a split from above by politics is not true - and the critics are not victims.</p></a>
<a id="S561" spellcheck><h2>Not a private matter</h2>
<p>Refusal to vaccinate causes burdens for the general public. In this respect, it is not a private matter if people do not get vaccinated, just as the discharge of wastewater is not a private matter for the factory owner.</p></a>
<a id="S562" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality is Long Covid</h2>
<p>The observed worldwide excess mortality is not due to vaccination side effects, but to the fact that many people still suffer and die from long-covid. These numbers will decline after the end of the pandemic.</p></a>
<a id="S563" spellcheck><h2>Politicians want to change the world</h2>
<p>It is not true that today's politicians are built up in cadre schools as puppets of powerful people. You go into politics out of conviction - to improve the world - not because you want to serve rich people.</p></a>
<a id="S564" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality depends on vaccination rate</h2>
<p>In a global comparison, excess mortality shows a direct correlation with the vaccination rate. The more people in a country are sufficiently vaccinated, the lower the excess mortality. This also proves the effectiveness of vaccination.</p></a>
<a id="S565" spellcheck><h2>How does the Bluetooth transmitter get into the syringe?</h2>
<p>If, as many critics claim, one is to become a Bluetooth transmitter as a vaccinated person, how does exactly one Bluetooth receiver from the vaccine vial get into each syringe? That is technically impossible and also not comprehensible.</p></a>
<a id="S566" spellcheck><h2>Media very self-critical</h2>
<p>Our mass media are following the political decisions during the Corona crisis very critically and are taking a very self-critical look at their own work. And much more so than the alternative media in the critics' bubble.</p></a>
<a id="S567" spellcheck><h2>Chinese envy us the vaccines</h2>
<p>The Chinese population envies our highly effective vaccines in the Western nations. Western vaccines are not very widespread there, and China simply cannot get out of the pandemic with its own, less effective ones.</p></a>
<a id="S568" spellcheck><h2>Tracking now impossible</h2>
<p>Because China has had to back away from its strict corona policy, tracking corona disease in the population is no longer possible. The Chinese health policy has failed and this has implications for the whole world.</p></a>
<a id="S569" spellcheck><h2>China's Covid Policy Seems Excessive</h2>
<p>China's restrictive no-covid policy with constant tests and quarantine warehouses seems excessive. However, that is still no reason to demand that we abandon all measures.</p></a>
<a id="S570" spellcheck><h2>China's vaccines are too poor</h2>
<p>The vaccines produced in China have much lower efficacy, forcing the country to adopt a no-covid policy and thus continued severe restrictions on the population.</p></a>
<a id="S571" spellcheck><h2>U-turn in China tricky</h2>
<p>The u-turn in the Chinese government's covid policy, is tricky given China's low vaccination and thus immunity rates. By scaling back the measures, the virus will spread exponentially again.</p></a>
<a id="S572" spellcheck><h2>Omikron XBB.1.5</h2>
<p>A new variant spreads faster worldwide than other variants because it is a recombianation of two variants. It seems that this variant is especially problematic for vaccinated people.</p></a>
<a id="S573" spellcheck><h2>Media only want sensations</h2>
<p>The reporting of the mass media can be explained by their tendency to want to generate clicks and thus sales with sensational news. There are no malicious intentions behind this, such as wanting to divide the population or instill fear.</p></a>
<a id="S574" spellcheck><h2>Chinese workers in Bergamo</h2>
<p>Bergamo as the first Corona hotspot is very understandable. In northern Italy, a great many Chinese work in the textile industry, in a very confined space. They have "flown in" the virus via the usual Chinese New Year travel wave.</p></a>
<a id="S575" spellcheck><h2>Excess mortality is flu wave</h2>
<p>Part of the unusually high excess mortality can be explained by a strong flu epidemic. Flu viruses can spread easily due to the immunocompromised population caused by Corona and are not infrequently fatal.</p></a>
<a id="S576" spellcheck><h2>Risk groups more likely to be vaccinated</h2>
<p>Hospital statistics showing high occupancy by multiple vaccinees are not evidence of ineffectiveness or harmfulness of vaccination, but rather an indication that there are many more vaccinated individuals in high-risk groups.</p></a>
<a id="S577"><h2>No flu because Covid vaccination also effective there</h2>
  <p>The statistical absence of influenza cases during the pandemic can be explained by the fact that the Covid vaccine is also effective against influenza. A claimed redefinition of flu cases as Covid has not occurred.</p></a>
<a id="S578"><h2>Lost respect for the virus</h2>
  <p>A major problem is that as the restrictions fall, people quickly lose respect for the virus and behave carelessly. As a result, a new wave of the virus can quickly lead to another outbreak.</p></a>
<a id="S579"><h2>Explainable with sensationalism</h2>
  <p>The panic media coverage of Covid can be explained solely by the fact that the news cycle constantly demands sensational stories and the measurement of success is by clicks rather than accuracy and clean research.</p></a>
<a id="S580"><h2>Intensive care units empty after vaccination</h2>
  <p>Clear evidence that vaccination has definitely had a positive impact on corona incidence is the fact that intensive care units emptied after major corona vaccination campaigns.</p></a>
<a id="S581"><h2>Mainly young men on ITS</h2>
  <p>Just how dangerous the virus was can be seen from the fact that a disproportionate number of young men ended up in intensive care during the strong outbreaks.</p></a>
<a id="S582"><h2>Death after vaccination statistically normal</h2>
  <p>The fact that during a large vaccination campaign some people die for other reasons after their vaccination is purely statistically normal. Just because two events coincide does not make them cause and effect.</p></a>
<a id="S583"><h2>Benefits outweigh side effects</h2>
  <p>While it appears that there are more severe vaccine side effects and deaths than expected, the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Without vaccination, there would have been significantly more Corona victims.</p></a>
<a id="S584"><h2>Cyberchondria</h2>
  <p>Side effects and problems after vaccination often arise due to a new form of hypochondria, so-called cyberchondria. The source is the Internet, which leads victims to self-diagnosis, which then becomes the real disease.</p></a>
<a id="S585"><h2>Dissolution of the control group was mandatory</h2>
  <p>The premature dissolution of the control group in the long-term study on Corona vaccination had to be done for ethical reasons: One could not deprive the control group of the effective vaccination, because that would be tantamount to human experimentation.</p></a>
<a id="S586"><h2>Transfer from tanuki</h2>
  <p>Transmission of the virus to humans in the form of a zoonosis is still more likely than the laboratory hypothesis. The tanuki is also a possible intermediate host as a vector.</p></a>
<a id="S587"><h2>Hybrid immunity</h2>
  <p>Previous infection together with vaccination leads to a so-called hybrid immunity against Corona, i.e. a strengthened immunological memory that provides better protection against the virus.</p></a>
<a id="S588"><h2>Also comply with senseless rules</h2>
  <p>Many rules that existed during and after the pandemic are more or less meaningless. But following rules is a sensible foundation of our civilization and is there to avoid chaos.</p></a>
<a id="S589"><h2>Failure to test falsifies pandemic</h2>
  <p>The declining number of documented infections comes from the sharp decline in testing. The number of covid cases remains high and currently many people continue to die daily from corona.</p></a>
<a id="S590"><h2>After the pandemic is before the pandemic</h2>
  <p>This pandemic has been overcome, but the next one is sure to come. We must take better precautions for this one and also lay down binding rules for everyone on how to deal with it.</p></a>
<a id="S591"><h2>China ist intransparent</h2>
  <p>The search for the virus origin - wild animal market or laboratory mishap - can only be successful with data from China. Only through their still pending release can further research be conducted.</p></a>
