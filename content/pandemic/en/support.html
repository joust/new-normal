<b>New Normal</b> is the artistic examination of the current era, which can probably best be described as counter-enlightenment. This manifests itself not only in division and increasing decay of politics and science, but also in a rapid enclosure of reality by powerful interest groups. The battle for the interpretation of major issues such as corona or climate change is fought with all means at hand and massively shapes thinking and public discourse. Mass and alternative media provide conflicting narratives. Enclosure can only be countered through transparency and education, and this work aims to contribute to that. 
</p><p>
The content should be in a form that is accessible to the online and gamer generation. Thereby with among other things the motive of the red and blue pill from the film Matrix is played. Despite the fact that the division of societies worldwide is real and tangible, it is also to be countered with humor. First and foremost, bridges are to be built and awareness and knowledge created. The app is aimed at people who want to seriously engage in discourse with the arguments of the opposing side. It wants to help people move toward each other again. It wants to be a valuable resource and enable an open and informed exchange.
</p><p>
The internationalized content (currently only on the topic of Corona) is maintained by a community of volunteers. For this purpose, tools common in software development with corresponding review processes will be used. The core is a gitlab instance. To participate in the community in the longer term, one can apply to the project for access. 
</p><p>
Even without access, one can contribute. The content is - like reality - in constant flux. New arguments are added regularly and others become irrelevant. In addition, there are arguments that are used and understood worldwide (the common core) and arguments that are used and understood only locally. Keeping that current can use all the support it can get!
