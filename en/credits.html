<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>I would like to thank all friends and family members who fearlessly got into discussions and ultimately provided the inspiration and content for this game. As well as
</p>
<ul>
<li>all scientists, who are fully committed to reason and the scientific approach,</li>
<li>all journalists, who see themselves as a real corrective and as the "fourth power",</li>
<li>all artists, who, despite the new normal, do not shy away from critical art and</li>
<li>all philosophers, who currently help us to make sense of whats happening through critical thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And finally these nerds who invented this internet.</p>
