<h1>The<i> Idiots</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="I1"><h2>Immune system?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our immune system protects us against viruses. And that, if we didn't have one, the good Lord would let us be born with an everyday mask.</p>
<a id="I2"><h2>PCR test not validated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all PCR test products used are not validated and therefore not approved for dia&shy;gnostic / clinical use. And that this is even stated on the package inserts.</p>
<a id="I3"><h2>PCR test only with symptoms</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, if at all, that PCR tests should only be used to find out whether the virus is involved in the disease (with symptoms). In healthy people the error rate should be much too high!</p>
<a id="I4"><h2>100 different PCR tests</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that there are hundreds of PCR test products from different manufacturers, all of which work differently and give different results. And that you can always get the result you need!</p>
<a id="I5"><h2>Funda&shy;mental rights</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the fundamental rights are called so because they cannot be overridden. And that all the decrees by which this is currently done are void and will not stand up in court.</p>
<a id="I6"><h2>Like in the 1930s</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our society is slipping into totali&shy;tarianism, just like germany did in the 1930s. And that we "sheeple" let this happen to us just like our "great-grandsheeple" did back then.</p>
<a id="I7"><h2>Disinfec&shy;tants useless</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that most disin&shy;fec&shy;tants are only effective against bacteria, but not against viruses (virucidity). And that they have no effect at all if the exposure time is not sufficient.</p>
<a id="I8"><h2>Masks of no use</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that almost all available scientific studies question the effectiveness of masks. And that Drosten himself has even admitted this several times.</p>
<a id="I9"><h2>Mask harmful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing masks for longer periods of time leads to an oxygen deficiency which is harmful to the human body. And that this results in permanent damage like the death of brain cells!</p>
<a id="I10"><h2>Illness- and suicide-rates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that measures with economic effects, especially lockdowns, drive people into distress, into virus and existen&shy;tial fear and into loneliness. And that the rates of illness and suicide multiply.</p>
<a id="I11"><h2>Measures worldwide fatal</h2></a>
<p>They<i> say in all seriousness</i> that the measures to contain the virus are claiming many more victims worldwide than the virus itself. And that according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) 1.6 billion people worldwide are threatened with the loss of their livelihoods!</p>
<a id="I12"><h2>Depopu&shy;lation plans</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>,  that the ongoing economic lockdowns are fatally wrong and leading to hunger and death of hundreds of millions of people. And that this fits in with the plans of elitist circles to drastically reduce the world population - for the good of us all.</p>
<a id="I13"><h2>Printing money dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a lot of money will be printed for all those who now have to be supported due to the measures. And that this makes the economic future unpredic&shy;table.</p>
<a id="I14"><h2>Great Reset</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Corona crisis is the vehicle for a hard restart of globa&shy;lized capita&shy;lism, according to the official Great Reset plan of the World Economic Forum (WEF). And that this has even been addressed by Grover in the Sesame Street.</p>
<a id="I15"><h2>Bill Gates no physician</h2>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Bill Gates, as a software developer and big pharma lobbyist, was not voted by anyone to decide on the medical fate of all of mankind. And that he, with his corrupt prac&shy;tices, only changed from the software business to another.</p>
<a id="I16"><h2>Children suffer</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that children are frigh&shy;tened, trauma&shy;tized and their develop&shy;ment is massively impaired by the current measures in daycare centers and schools. And that this is completely dis&shy;propor&shy;tionate.</p>
<a id="I17"><h2>Look to Australia</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the Austra&shy;lian state of Victoria, local politics has combined a drastic lockdown with curfews and full surveil&shy;lance of the population. And that not even demons&shy;trating was legally possible.</p>
<a id="I18"><h2>Parliamen&shy;tary reser&shy;vation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all decisions which are of substan&shy;tial weight for the community must be decided in the parlia&shy;ment. And that this should apply in parti&shy;cular to Corona measures and regula&shy;tions.</p>
<a id="I19"><h2>Threat of fascism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one can observe a world-wide seizure of power by the executive. And that therefore, with the words of Adorno, one fears the return of fascism in the guise of democracy!</p>
<a id="I20"><h2>Like GDR 2.0</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state's willing&shy;ness to take measures and the lack of expla&shy;nations for their plausi&shy;bility have a lot to do with the east german GDR regime. The whole thing seems like a modern remake of the real existing socialism.</p>
<a id="I21"><h2>Scientific discourse</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are also innu&shy;merable scien&shy;tists, who rate the usefulness of the measures and the risk posed by the virus completely different. And that they must be included in the public discourse.</p>
<a id="I22"><h2>Positive test not disease</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a positive PCR test detects neither infection nor disease, as only symptoms allow such a diagnosis. And that there&shy;fore the use of these terms in the media is completely wrong and misleading.</p>
<a id="I23"><h2>Viruses do not exist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a valid scien&shy;tific position is that there are no viruses. And that the effects ascribed to them actually result from the body's own exosomes!</p>
<a id="I24"><h2>Flatten the Curve?!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we have long since stopped using the occupancy rate of our hospitals as a measure and instead are using arbi&shy;trary numbers like positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants. And that these figures no longer allow any statements about real risks.</p>
<a id="I25"><h2>Not without us!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in hardly transparent and unelected structures it was and is decided how the whole world should be "re-started". And that the ones who have to cope with the results would have to be included in the decisions.</p>
<a id="I26"><h2>infection fatality rate 0.x%</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, according to many studies, the infec&shy;tious mortality rate IFR is about as high for the novel virus as for the influenza virus. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk.</p>
<a id="I27"><h2>Mild Flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the new virus is about as dangerous as a medium flu. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk to the vast majority of the population.</p>
<a id="I28"><h2>PCR-Tests Big business</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that PCR tests are a billion-dollar business for many pharma&shy;ceutical companies. And that these profits are out of all proportion compared to the benefits for the general public.</p>
<a id="I29"><h2>Vaccines Big business</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccines are a relatively low-risk billion-dollar business for pharma&shy;ceutical companies. And that Bill Gates himself has have estimated the return on invest&shy;ment (ROI) at 2200%.</p>
<a id="I30"><h2>Censorship</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that inform&shy;ation contra&shy;dicting the official narrative regarding the virus exists, but is censored in the media. And that this gives the popula&shy;tion a false impression.</p>
<a id="I31"><h2>Mani&shy;pu&shy;lation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a lot of the information that is communi&shy;cated in the official Corona story is mani&shy;pulated. And that those who fall for it, get misleaded by handling information uncriti&shy;cally.</p>
<a id="I32"><h2>Media spreads fear</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our mass media currently tends to stir up dispro&shy;portio&shy;nate fears in the population. And that these fears lead to a strong increase of anxiety disorders and suicides!</p>
<a id="I33"><h2>No excess mortality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is no excess mortality at all on an annual average worldwide. And that this means that the risk of death has not changed compared to previous years.</p>
<a id="I34"><h2>No Flu any more</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that since corona victim numbers are presented, statistically hardly any influenza victims are recorded. And that this indicates that there is simply a statistical reinter&shy;preta&shy;tion of these victims.</p>
<a id="I35"><h2>Age mortality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the average age at which virus victims die worldwide is the same as the normal mortality rate in their respective countries. And that usually a positive test, sometimes not even that is enough for getting counted as a Corona death.</p>
<a id="I36"><h2>Swine flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that every&shy;thing we are experien&shy;cing right now has already happened like this before 10 years ago with the swine flu, even with the same actors! And at that time was exposed as an expen&shy;sive lobby operation of the pharma&shy;ceutical industry.</p>
<a id="I37"><h2>Knows no one</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, just because they do not know anybody in their circle of acquain&shy;tances who is seriously ill or has died from the virus, it cannot be the "killer virus" it is thought to be.</p>
<a id="I38"><h2>Sweden no lockdown</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Sweden, although it did not prescribe measures like lock&shy;downs but only recommen&shy;ded them to its citizens, is now no different from the rest of the world. And that this would be an indication that lockdowns are useless.</p>
<a id="I39"><h2>Great Barrington Declaration</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are tens of thousands of scientists and physicians who ask for completely different measures, but they are not heard. And that their position can be read in the "Great Barring&shy;ton Decla&shy;ration".</p>
</p>
<a id="I40"><h2>Central Bank Digi&shy;tal Currency</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that while we all are busy with the virus, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is being realized in the background, soon used by all of us. And that the possibility to pay anonymously will quickly disappear!</p>
<a id="I41"><h2>Pandemic criteria lowered</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the WHO criteria for a pandemic were lowered during the swine flu crisis, which was demons&shy;trably staged by the pharma&shy;ceutical industry in 2009 to boost its vaccine sales. And that this circum&shy;stance has only made the current pandemic possible.</p>
<a id="I42"><h2>WHO = Big Pharma</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the World Health Organi&shy;zation (WHO) is not an inde&shy;pendent insti&shy;tution that takes care of all of us. And that it is financed and controlled by pharma&shy;ceutical companies for profit.</p>
<a id="I43"><h2>Bill Gates controls ...</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, Bill Gates and his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the trust of the same name would make profits for pharma&shy;ceutical companies under the guise of philan&shy;thropy. And that is one of the drivers for the crisis.</p>
<a id="I44"><h2>Wrong intensive treatment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the treatment of many patients seriously ill with the virus with ventilators would be wrong and would even increase mortality. And that just the simple treatment with oxygen would be demons&shy;trably more successful.</p>
<a id="I45"><h2>Autopsies</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that without an autopsy it is usually impos&shy;sible to deter&shy;mine which of the hundreds of respira&shy;tory viruses or other diseases a patient died of. And that in many countries the positive test alone is the basis for the declaration of COVID death.</p>
<a id="I46"><h2>WITH not BY the virus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is not at all clear how many of the virus victims died FROM and how many died only WITH the virus. And that this cannot even be determined by testing for a single virus.</p>
<a id="I47"><h2>No asymp&shy;to&shy;ma&shy;tic trans&shy;mission</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that according to studies, transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers is practically non-existent. And that the measures decreed wordwide onto healthy people are therefore superfluous.</p>
<a id="I48"><h2>PLANdemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the pandemic must actually be called a PLANdemic, because it was obviously prepared for a long time. And that there is uncountable, well-documented evidence of this.</p>
<a id="I49"><h2>Event 201</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the pandemic exercise "Event 201" from October 2019, shortly before the outbreak of the real pandemic in China, is a central indication that we are dealing with a planned event.</p>
<a id="I50"><h2>Intensive beds normal</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that an increasing number of occupied intensive care beds is normal during the cold season and happens every year. And that the figures are deliberately not presented in the context of previous years.</p>
<a id="I51"><h2>Test pandemic only</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the so called "second wave" is mainly a "test pandemic" because neither the occu&shy;pancy of inten&shy;sive care beds nor the number of deaths follows the steep rise in positive test results. And that in many countries these values are even going into the other direction.</p>
<a id="I52"><h2>Lockdowns kill!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that excess morta&shy;lity peaks worldwide are caused by the imposition of measures such as lockdowns and not by the virus! And that this can also be proven by looking at the data.</p>
<a id="I53"><h2>Immune System not a Topic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that before Corona during the flu season one important topic in the media always was how to strengthen your immune system. And that now, in the Corona time, this is strangely enough no longer important.</p>
<a id="I54"><h2>False positive rate high</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that at low preva&shy;lence - spread of the virus - mass tests of healthy people have an exorbi&shy;tantly high false positive rate. And that other factors in the test procedure also nega&shy;tively influence this rate and are not trans&shy;parent. <b> Idiots?!</b></p>
<a id="I55"><h2>mRNA vaccines dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA vaccines, that are now used on a massive scale against the virus, have never been approved before. And that nothing can be known about the long-term conse&shy;quences.</p>
<a id="I56"><h2>Forced vaccination comes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one will not get around getting vacci&shy;nated, because although there is no obli&shy;gation in many countries, the pressure will be very high. And that without vacci&shy;nation you will be denied many things (e.g. travel, culture etc.).</p>
<a id="I57"><h2>Youtube deletes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that YouTube is deleting critical videos on the virus topic and blocks, demonetizes and shadowbans channels. And that their decisions are only based on whether the content is in line with the official narrative. And that one should therefore not rely on YouTube an more.</p>
<a id="I58"><h2>Hyper inflation is coming</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the large amount of money currently being printed and distri&shy;buted in indus&shy;tria&shy;lized nations worldwide to support the losers of the crisis increases the risk of hyper inflation.</p>
<a id="I59"><h2>Hearing other doctors</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are also countless doctors who see the current virus crisis with com&shy;pletely different eyes. And that their com&shy;petence is just as relevant as that of the doctors who follow the official narrative.</p>
<a id="I60"><h2>Side effects known</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the rush-deve&shy;loped Corona vaccines have led to severe side effects and deaths in their radi&shy;cally shor&shy;tened test phases. And that it is irre&shy;spon&shy;sible to use them for mass vacci&shy;nation.</p>
<a id="I61"><h2>World govern&shy;ment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are open plans and activi&shy;ties to centra&shy;lize govern&shy;mental power in global institutions in the coming years as the virus crisis continues. And that as a result we are heading for an authori&shy;tarian and techno&shy;cratic world govern&shy;ment.</p>
<a id="I62"><h2>Democracy at its end</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our democratic order is in great danger because of the crisis and especially because of the measures decreed. And that it is currently not foresee&shy;able that the state of emergency with suspen&shy;sion of basic rights will be reversed at all.</p>
<a id="I63"><h2>Insolvency of Capitalism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the globalized, neoliberal turbo-capitalism has once again reached the end of its cycle. And that its collapse is being disguised by the virus crisis and is currently being resolved to the advantage of the elites.</p>
<a id="I64"><h2>Hundreds of other viruses</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are hundreds of other viruses besides the SARS-Cov-2, which mani&shy;fest themselves in respi&shy;ratory diseases with compa&shy;rable symptoms. And that the human organism is typically affected by many of these viruses at the same time and therefore testing for only one of them is hardly meaningful.</p>
<a id="I65"><h2>Listen to critics</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that listening to science would require acknow&shy;ledging scientific contra&shy;dictions and making the scien&shy;tific discourse that has emerged visible to the public and the media. And that any&shy;thing else would be unscientific.</p>
<a id="I66"><h2>Treatment long available</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that several even inex&shy;pensive treat&shy;ments for COVID have long been available. And that there is just no money to be made with and therefore they are withhold or even discre&shy;dited.</p>
<a id="I67"><h2>Forced digiti&shy;zation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the digital economy is receiving a strong boost in the wake of the virus crisis. And that with the reali&shy;zation of digital identity solutions in conjunc&shy;tion with immunity passes, it will quickly and radi&shy;cally transform our world in the direc&shy;tion of a techno&shy;cracy.</p>
<a id="I68"><h2>Protect risk groups</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it would be much more sensible if not all healthy people took measures to protect others, but only the risk groups would take measures to protect them&shy;selves. And that many epi&shy;demiolo&shy;gists and immunolo&shy;gists see it that way, too.</p>
<a id="I69"><h2>No Pandemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is no overall statis&shy;tical excess mortality compared to earlier years. And that this is proof enough that we are not dealing with an epidemic or medical crisis!</p>
<a id="I86"><h2>Flu season every year</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that every year during the flu season, respi&shy;ratory ill&shy;nesses spike and hospi&shy;tals are over&shy;whelmed. And that therefore what we're experi&shy;encing now is no special situation.</p>
<a id="I71"><h2>Crisis substitute for war</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis is being deli&shy;berately countered with unsui&shy;table measures to destroy as much as possible, as in a war. And that capitalism has always rehabili&shy;tated itself this way!</p>
<a id="I72"><h2>ct value not standar&shy;dized</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that there is no fixed threshold of the ct-value - meaning the number of repro&shy;duction cycles as a measure for the existing virus load - for the PCR&nbsp;test to evaluate as positive! And that this test can thus be politi&shy;cally abused in any way.</p>
<a id="I73"><h2>Use your brain!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one should not be put into fear and apathy by the media but use one's mind to evaluate the openly available infor&shy;mation. And that one would then come to different conclusions!</p>
<a id="I74"><h2>Wake up!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who hasn't noticed that a false game is being played here can no longer be rescued. And that during this crisis everyone can know on which side they would have been in Germany in the 1930s.</p>
<a id="I75"><h2>Herd immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that herd immunity is not a strategy but simply a fact. And that in most countries it probably has long been achieved since the beginning of the crisis.</p>
<a id="I76"><h2>T-cell immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we don't need to be vaccinated on a large scale because a large part of the population already has basic T-cell immunity from expositions to similar viruses. And that the pharma&shy;ceutical industry suppresses this infor&shy;mation.</p>
<a id="I77"><h2>Filter bubble</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who rely on mass media are in a filter bubble when it comes to the virus issue. And that this filter bubble massi&shy;vely distorts their percep&shy;tion of reality.</p>
<a id="I78"><h2>Finan&shy;cial incen&shy;tives</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that in many countries Corona case numbers and intensive care bed occupancy are being driven up by financial incentives. And that through these incentives more money can be earned with both positively tested treated and deceased patients.</p>
<a id="I79"><h2>Milgram Experi&shy;ment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that we are currently in the middle of a huge, unpre&shy;ceden&shy;ted human experiment. And that it resembles, among others, the frigh&shy;tening Milgram experi&shy;ment, which tested the effect of authority on humans.</p>
<a id="I80"><h2>Healthcare was Cut Back</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that politics before Corona has cut back the national health system in various ways and so that its overloading is now to be expected. And that they have not changed anything since the beginning of the crisis!</p>
<a id="I81"><h2>Dark Winter</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the winter 2020/2021 is since long called "Dark Winter" by the insider "planners" of this crisis. And that we have to be prepared for many more planned depriva&shy;tions!</p>
<a id="I82"><h2>Pressure from above?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are indica&shy;tions that politi&shy;cians and officials are getting pressure "from above" natio&shy;nally and inter&shy;natio&shy;nally, for example from the IMF, to approve or imple&shy;ment harmful measures. And that they proba&shy;bly even have made an example of some critics diver&shy;ging too much!</p>
<a id="I83"><h2>Vitamin D</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that studies show that vitamin&nbsp;D defi&shy;ciency signi&shy;ficant&shy;ly worsens the course of COVID diseases. And that the pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion of vitamin&nbsp;D alone promises massive success in preven&shy;tion and treat&shy;ment!</p>
<a id="I84"><h2>Fact checkers biased</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many fact checkers on the Corona issue are not driven by the truth, but by interests. And that they there&shy;fore are the real life equivalent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's "1984"!</p>
<a id="I85"><h2>People always die</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that death is the only cer&shy;tainty in life. And that a painful death, as it is regu&shy;larly reported in the media right now in connec&shy;tion with Corona, was also the norm in the time before Corona.</p>
<a id="I86"><h2>Postponed OPs</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that millions of sche&shy;duled OPs have been post&shy;poned world&shy;wide, and people in general have fore&shy;gone medical checks and treat&shy;ments out of fear. And that this has led to much more premature suffering and death.</p>
<a id="I87"><h2>Lockdowns ineffec&shy;tive</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that measures such as lock&shy;downs and school closures have had and continue to have no effect on Corona infection inci&shy;dence. And that, in contrast, these are causing more and more suffe&shy;ring and death in other areas.</p>
<a id="I88"><h2>Staying Alive not Living</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>  that we are losing sight of living for staying alive. And that the currently imposed measures like lockdowns and curfews falsely suggest to people that staying alive equals living.</p>
<a id="I89"><h2>Vaccine there too fast</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the development of working mRNA vaccines for Corona started much too early and has been successful far too quickly compared to previous experiences. And that this should be cause for very critical consideration!</p>
<a id="I90"><h2>1984</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the current situation is very reminiscent of the dystopia "1984" by George Orwell. And that it was certainly not meant to be an template or instruction manual!</p>
<a id="I91"><h2>Vacci&shy;nation senseless</h2></a>
<p>They say <i> in all seriousness</i> that a vacci&shy;nation makes little sense, since among other things its effectiveness is not known and already infected persons do not need it at all. And that the vacci&shy;nation brings us no step closer to a normalization of our lives.</p>
<a id="I92"><h2>Guinea Pigs</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the inade&shy;quate testing of the vaccines, their forced fast-track approval, and the already known side effects only suggest that the current mass vacci&shy;nation is an irrespon&shy;sible human experi&shy;ment.</p>
<a id="I93"><h2>Not about health</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our politics is neither concerned about our health nor about our health&shy;care system, since it would have acted comple&shy;tely different otherwise today and in the last decades!</p>
<a id="I94"><h2>Artists stand up</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that more and more artists are remind&shy;ing themselves on their role as critical commen&shy;tators on our world. And that Eric Clapton and Van Morrison are parti&shy;cularly note&shy;worthy in this regard!</p>
<a id="I95"><h2>Herd Immunity Criteria</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that beginning with the Corona vaccination, the WHO has changed its definition of herd immunity so that natural immunity no longer has any meaning. And that it therefore can only be achieved through vaccination.</p>
<a id="I96"><h2>First vaccination victims</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> yet all seriousness</i> that there are already first victims of the vaccination, which are barely covered in the mass media. And that this was predic&shy;table given the rush in which the vaccines were developed and tested.</p>
<a id="I97"><h2>We all get chipped</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the ultimate goal of intro&shy;ducing a worldwide vacci&shy;nation regime is to bring all people under control via micro-chips. And that this will also involve ubiquitous net&shy;working with 5G.</p>
<a id="I98"><h2>Won't go away</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that corona finally has to be considered as just another of many infectious diseases we humans have to live with. And that there are simply no measures to make it disappear again.</p>
<a id="I99"><h2>Oath of Hippo&shy;crates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that physicians commit themselves according to the Oath of Hippocrates not to harm their patients. And that for this reason alone they would have to reject the measures because of their harmfulness.</p>
<a id="I100"><h2>My Body my Choice</h2></a>

<a id="I116"><h2>Virus not isolated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus has still not been isolated as required by Koch's postulates. And that this alone should be enough to stop the whole thing immediately.</p>
<a id="I117"><h2>Vaccinated further contagious</h2></a>
