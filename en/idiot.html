<h1>The<i> Idiots</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="I1"><h2>Immune system?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our immune system protects us against viruses. And that, if we didn't have one, the good Lord would let us be born with an everyday mask.</p>
<a id="I2"><h2>PCR test not validated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all PCR test products used are not validated and therefore not approved for dia&shy;gnostic / clinical use. And that this is even stated on the package inserts.</p>
<a id="I3"><h2>PCR test only with symptoms</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, if at all, that PCR tests should only be used to find out whether the virus is involved in the disease (with symptoms). In healthy people the error rate should be much too high!</p>
<a id="I4"><h2>100 different PCR tests</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that there are hundreds of PCR test products from different manufacturers, all of which work differently and give different results. And that you can always get the result you need!</p>
<a id="I5"><h2>Funda&shy;mental rights</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the fundamental rights are called so because they cannot be overridden. And that all the decrees by which this is currently done are void and will not stand up in court.</p>
<a id="I6"><h2>Like in the 1930s</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our society is slipping into totali&shy;tarianism, just like germany did in the 1930s. And that we "sheeple" let this happen to us just like our "great-grandsheeple" did back then.</p>
<a id="I7"><h2>Disinfec&shy;tants useless</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that most disin&shy;fec&shy;tants are only effective against bacteria, but not against viruses (virucidity). And that they have no effect at all if the exposure time is not sufficient.</p>
<a id="I8"><h2>Masks of no use</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that almost all available scientific studies question the effectiveness of masks. And that Drosten himself has even admitted this several times.</p>
<a id="I9"><h2>Mask harmful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing masks for longer periods of time leads to an oxygen deficiency which is harmful to the human body. And that this results in permanent damage like the death of brain cells!</p>
<a id="I10"><h2>Illness- and suicide-rates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that measures with economic effects, especially lockdowns, drive people into distress, into virus and existen&shy;tial fear and into loneliness. And that the rates of illness and suicide multiply.</p>
<a id="I11"><h2>Measures worldwide fatal</h2></a>
<p>They<i> say in all seriousness</i> that the measures to contain the virus are claiming many more victims worldwide than the virus itself. And that according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) 1.6 billion people worldwide are threatened with the loss of their livelihoods!</p>
<a id="I12"><h2>Depopu&shy;lation plans</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>,  that the ongoing economic lockdowns are fatally wrong and leading to hunger and death of hundreds of millions of people. And that this fits in with the plans of elitist circles to drastically reduce the world population - for the good of us all.</p>
<a id="I13"><h2>Printing money dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a lot of money will be printed for all those who now have to be supported due to the measures. And that this makes the economic future unpredic&shy;table.</p>
<a id="I14"><h2>Great Reset</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Corona crisis is the vehicle for a hard restart of globa&shy;lized capita&shy;lism, according to the official Great Reset plan of the World Economic Forum (WEF). And that this has even been addressed by Grover in the Sesame Street.</p>
<a id="I15"><h2>Bill Gates no physician</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Bill Gates, as a software developer and big pharma lobbyist, was not voted by anyone to decide on the medical fate of all of mankind. And that he, with his corrupt prac&shy;tices, only changed from the software business to another.</p>
<a id="I16"><h2>Children suffer</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that children are frigh&shy;tened, trauma&shy;tized and their develop&shy;ment is massively impaired by the current measures in daycare centers and schools. And that this is completely dis&shy;propor&shy;tionate.</p>
<a id="I17"><h2>Look to Australia</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the Austra&shy;lian state of Victoria, local politics has combined a drastic lockdown with curfews and full surveil&shy;lance of the population. And that not even demons&shy;trating was legally possible.</p>
<a id="I18"><h2>Parliamen&shy;tary reser&shy;vation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all decisions which are of substan&shy;tial weight for the community must be decided in the parlia&shy;ment. And that this should apply in parti&shy;cular to Corona measures and regula&shy;tions.</p>
<a id="I19"><h2>Threat of fascism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one can observe a world-wide seizure of power by the executive. And that therefore, with the words of Adorno, one fears the return of fascism in the guise of democracy!</p>
<a id="I20"><h2>Like GDR 2.0</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state's willing&shy;ness to take measures and the lack of expla&shy;nations for their plausi&shy;bility have a lot to do with the east german GDR regime. The whole thing seems like a modern remake of the real existing socialism.</p>
<a id="I21"><h2>Scientific discourse</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are also innu&shy;merable scien&shy;tists, who rate the usefulness of the measures and the risk posed by the virus completely different. And that they must be included in the public discourse.</p>
<a id="I22"><h2>Positive test not disease</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a positive PCR test detects neither infection nor disease, as only symptoms allow such a diagnosis. And that there&shy;fore the use of these terms in the media is completely wrong and misleading.</p>
<a id="I23"><h2>Viruses do not exist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a valid scien&shy;tific position is that there are no viruses. And that the effects ascribed to them actually result from the body's own exosomes!</p>
<a id="I24"><h2>Flatten the Curve?!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we have long since stopped using the occupancy rate of our hospitals as a measure and instead are using arbi&shy;trary numbers like positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants. And that these figures no longer allow any statements about real risks.</p>
<a id="I25"><h2>Not without us!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in hardly transparent and unelected structures it was and is decided how the whole world should be "re-started". And that the ones who have to cope with the results would have to be included in the decisions.</p>
<a id="I26"><h2>infection fatality rate 0.x%</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, according to many studies, the infec&shy;tious mortality rate IFR is about as high for the novel virus as for the influenza virus. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk.</p>
<a id="I27"><h2>Mild Flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the new virus is about as dangerous as a medium flu. And that it therefore does not pose an increased risk to the vast majority of the population.</p>
<a id="I28"><h2>PCR-Tests Big business</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that PCR tests are a billion-dollar business for many pharma&shy;ceutical companies. And that these profits are out of all proportion compared to the benefits for the general public.</p>
<a id="I29"><h2>Vaccines Big business</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccines are a relatively low-risk billion-dollar business for pharma&shy;ceutical companies. And that Bill Gates himself has have estimated the return on invest&shy;ment (ROI) at 2200%.</p>
<a id="I30"><h2>Censorship</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that inform&shy;ation contra&shy;dicting the official narrative regarding the virus exists, but is censored in the media. And that this gives the popula&shy;tion a false impression.</p>
<a id="I31"><h2>Mani&shy;pu&shy;lation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a lot of the information that is communi&shy;cated in the official Corona story is mani&shy;pulated. And that those who fall for it, get misleaded by handling information uncriti&shy;cally.</p>
<a id="I32"><h2>Media spreads fear</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our mass media currently tends to stir up dispro&shy;portio&shy;nate fears in the population. And that these fears lead to a strong increase of anxiety disorders and suicides!</p>
<a id="I33"><h2>No excess mortality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is no excess mortality at all on an annual average worldwide. And that this means that the risk of death has not changed compared to previous years.</p>
<a id="I34"><h2>No Flu any more</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that since corona victim numbers are presented, statistically hardly any influenza victims are recorded. And that this indicates that there is simply a statistical reinter&shy;preta&shy;tion of these victims.</p>
<a id="I35"><h2>Age mortality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the average age at which virus victims die worldwide is the same as the normal mortality rate in their respective countries. And that usually a positive test, sometimes not even that is enough for getting counted as a Corona death.</p>
<a id="I36"><h2>Swine flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that every&shy;thing we are experien&shy;cing right now has already happened like this before 10 years ago with the swine flu, even with the same actors! And at that time was exposed as an expen&shy;sive lobby operation of the pharma&shy;ceutical industry.</p>
<a id="I37"><h2>Knows no one</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, just because they do not know anybody in their circle of acquain&shy;tances who is seriously ill or has died from the virus, it cannot be the "killer virus" it is thought to be.</p>
<a id="I38"><h2>Sweden successful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>  that Sweden, despite having only made recommendations to its citizens, is now doing better than the rest of the world. And that this would be a clear indication that the measures imposed elsewhere have not brought any improvement.</p>
<a id="I39"><h2>Great Barrington Declaration</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are tens of thousands of scientists and physicians who ask for completely different measures, but they are not heard. And that their position can be read in the "Great Barring&shy;ton Decla&shy;ration".</p>
<a id="I40"><h2>Central Bank Digi&shy;tal Currency</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that while we all are busy with the virus, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is being realized in the background, soon used by all of us. And that the possibility to pay anonymously will quickly disappear!</p>
<a id="I41"><h2>Pandemic criteria lowered</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the WHO criteria for a pandemic were lowered during the swine flu crisis, which was demons&shy;trably staged by the pharma&shy;ceutical industry in 2009 to boost its vaccine sales. And that this circum&shy;stance has only made the current pandemic possible.</p>
<a id="I42"><h2>WHO = Big Pharma</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the World Health Organi&shy;zation (WHO) is not an inde&shy;pendent insti&shy;tution that takes care of all of us. And that it is financed and controlled by pharma&shy;ceutical companies for profit.</p>
<a id="I43"><h2>Bill Gates controls ...</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, Bill Gates and his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the trust of the same name would make profits for pharma&shy;ceutical companies under the guise of philan&shy;thropy. And that is one of the drivers for the crisis.</p>
<a id="I44"><h2>Wrong intensive treatment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the treatment of many patients seriously ill with the virus with ventilators would be wrong and would even increase mortality. And that just the simple treatment with oxygen would be demons&shy;trably more successful.</p>
<a id="I45"><h2>Autopsies</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that without an autopsy it is usually impos&shy;sible to deter&shy;mine which of the hundreds of respira&shy;tory viruses or other diseases a patient died of. And that in many countries the positive test alone is the basis for the declaration of COVID death.</p>
<a id="I46"><h2>WITH not BY the virus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is not at all clear how many of the virus victims died FROM and how many died only WITH the virus. And that this cannot even be determined by testing for a single virus.</p>
<a id="I47"><h2>No asymp&shy;to&shy;ma&shy;tic trans&shy;mission</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that according to studies, transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers is practically non-existent. And that the measures decreed wordwide onto healthy people are therefore superfluous.</p>
<a id="I48"><h2>PLANdemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the pandemic must actually be called a PLANdemic, because it was obviously prepared for a long time. And that there is uncountable, well-documented evidence of this.</p>
<a id="I49"><h2>Event 201</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the pandemic exercise "Event 201" from October 2019, shortly before the outbreak of the real pandemic in China, is a central indication that we are dealing with a planned event.</p>
<a id="I50"><h2>Intensive beds normal</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that an increasing number of occupied intensive care beds is normal during the cold season and happens every year. And that the figures are deliberately not presented in the context of previous years.</p>
<a id="I51"><h2>Test pandemic only</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the so called "second wave" is mainly a "test pandemic" because neither the occu&shy;pancy of inten&shy;sive care beds nor the number of deaths follows the steep rise in positive test results. And that in many countries these values are even going into the other direction.</p>
<a id="I52"><h2>Lockdowns kill!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that excess morta&shy;lity peaks worldwide are caused by the imposition of measures such as lockdowns and not by the virus! And that this can also be proven by looking at the data.</p>
<a id="I53"><h2>Immune System not a Topic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that before Corona during the flu season one important topic in the media always was how to strengthen your immune system. And that now, in the Corona time, this is strangely enough no longer important.</p>
<a id="I54"><h2>False positive rate high</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that at low preva&shy;lence - spread of the virus - mass tests of healthy people have an exorbi&shy;tantly high false positive rate. And that other factors in the test procedure also nega&shy;tively influence this rate and are not trans&shy;parent. <b> Idiots?!</b></p>
<a id="I55"><h2>mRNA vaccines dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA vaccines, that are now used on a massive scale against the virus, have never been approved before. And that nothing can be known about the long-term conse&shy;quences.</p>
<a id="I56"><h2>Forced vaccination comes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one will not get around getting vacci&shy;nated, because although there is no obli&shy;gation in many countries, the pressure will be very high. And that without vacci&shy;nation you will be denied many things (e.g. travel, culture etc.).</p>
<a id="I57"><h2>Youtube deletes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that YouTube is deleting critical videos on the virus topic and blocks, demonetizes and shadowbans channels. And that their decisions are only based on whether the content is in line with the official narrative. And that one should therefore not rely on YouTube an more.</p>
<a id="I58"><h2>Hyper inflation is coming</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the large amount of money currently being printed and distri&shy;buted in indus&shy;tria&shy;lized nations worldwide to support the losers of the crisis increases the risk of hyper inflation.</p>
<a id="I59"><h2>Hearing other experts</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are also countless experts who see the current virus crisis with com&shy;pletely different eyes. And that their com&shy;petence is just as relevant as that of the experts who follow the official narrative.</p>
<a id="I60"><h2>Adverse effects known</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the rush-deve&shy;loped Corona vaccines have led to severe adverse effects and deaths in their radi&shy;cally shor&shy;tened test phases. And that it is irre&shy;spon&shy;sible to use them for mass vacci&shy;nation.</p>
<a id="I61"><h2>World govern&shy;ment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are open plans and activi&shy;ties to centra&shy;lize govern&shy;mental power in global institutions in the coming years as the virus crisis continues. And that as a result we are heading for an authori&shy;tarian and techno&shy;cratic world govern&shy;ment.</p>
<a id="I62"><h2>Democracy at its end</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our democratic order is in great danger because of the crisis and especially because of the measures decreed. And that it is currently not foresee&shy;able that the state of emergency with suspen&shy;sion of basic rights will be reversed at all.</p>
<a id="I63"><h2>Insolvency of Capitalism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the globalized, neoliberal turbo-capitalism has once again reached the end of its cycle. And that its collapse is being disguised by the virus crisis and is currently being resolved to the advantage of the elites.</p>
<a id="I64"><h2>Hundreds of other viruses</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are hundreds of other viruses besides the SARS-Cov-2, which mani&shy;fest themselves in respi&shy;ratory diseases with compa&shy;rable symptoms. And that the human organism is typically affected by many of these viruses at the same time and therefore testing for only one of them is hardly meaningful.</p>
<a id="I65"><h2>Listen to critics, too</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that listening to science would require acknow&shy;ledging scientific contra&shy;dictions and making the scien&shy;tific discourse that has emerged visible to the public and the media. And that any&shy;thing else is not science at all.</p>
<a id="I66"><h2>Treatment long available</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that several even inex&shy;pensive treat&shy;ments for COVID have long been available. And that there is just no money to be made with and therefore they are withhold or even discre&shy;dited.</p>
<a id="I67"><h2>Forced digiti&shy;zation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the digital economy is receiving a strong boost in the wake of the virus crisis. And that with the reali&shy;zation of digital identity solutions in conjunc&shy;tion with immunity passes, it will quickly and radi&shy;cally transform our world in the direc&shy;tion of a techno&shy;cracy.</p>
<a id="I68"><h2>Protect risk groups</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it would be much more sensible if not all healthy people took measures to protect others, but only the risk groups would take measures to protect them&shy;selves. And that many epi&shy;demiolo&shy;gists and immunolo&shy;gists see it that way, too.</p>
<a id="I69"><h2>No Pandemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is no overall statis&shy;tical excess mortality compared to earlier years. And that this is proof enough that we are not dealing with an epidemic or medical crisis!</p>
<a id="I70"><h2>Flu season every year</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that every year during the flu season, respi&shy;ratory ill&shy;nesses spike and hospi&shy;tals are over&shy;whelmed. And that therefore what we're experi&shy;encing now is no special situation.</p>
<a id="I71"><h2>Crisis substitute for war</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis is being deli&shy;berately countered with unsui&shy;table measures to destroy as much as possible, as in a war. And that capitalism has always rehabili&shy;tated itself this way!</p>
<a id="I72"><h2>ct value not standar&shy;dized</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that there is no fixed threshold of the ct-value - meaning the number of repro&shy;duction cycles as a measure for the existing virus load - for the PCR&nbsp;test to evaluate as positive! And that this test can thus be politi&shy;cally abused in any way.</p>
<a id="I73"><h2>Use your brain!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one should not be put into fear and apathy by the media but use one's mind to evaluate the openly available infor&shy;mation. And that one would then come to different conclusions!</p>
<a id="I74"><h2>Wake up!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who hasn't noticed that a false game is being played here can no longer be rescued. And that during this crisis everyone can know on which side they would have been in Germany in the 1930s.</p>
<a id="I75"><h2>Herd immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that herd immunity is not a strategy but simply a fact. And that in most countries it probably has long been achieved since the beginning of the crisis.</p>
<a id="I76"><h2>T-cell immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we don't need to be vaccinated on a large scale because a large part of the population already has basic T-cell immunity from expositions to similar viruses. And that the pharma&shy;ceutical industry suppresses this infor&shy;mation.</p>
<a id="I77"><h2>Filter bubble</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who rely on mass media are in a filter bubble when it comes to the virus issue. And that this filter bubble massi&shy;vely distorts their percep&shy;tion of reality.</p>
<a id="I78"><h2>Finan&shy;cial incen&shy;tives</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that in many countries Corona case numbers and intensive care bed occupancy are being driven up by financial incentives. And that through these incentives more money can be earned with both positively tested treated and deceased patients.</p>
<a id="I79"><h2>Milgram Experi&shy;ment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that we are currently in the middle of a huge, unpre&shy;ceden&shy;ted human experiment. And that it resembles, among others, the frigh&shy;tening Milgram experi&shy;ment, which tested the effect of authority on humans.</p>
<a id="I80"><h2>Healthcare was Cut Back</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that politics before Corona has cut back the national health system in various ways and so that its overloading is now to be expected. And that they have not changed anything since the beginning of the crisis!</p>
<a id="I81"><h2>Dark Winter</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the winter 2020/2021 is since long called "Dark Winter" by the insider "planners" of this crisis. And that we have to be prepared for many more planned depriva&shy;tions!</p>
<a id="I82"><h2>Pressure from above?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are indica&shy;tions that politi&shy;cians and officials are getting pressure "from above" natio&shy;nally and inter&shy;natio&shy;nally, for example from the IMF, to approve or imple&shy;ment harmful measures. And that they proba&shy;bly even have made an example of some critics centerer&shy;ging too much!</p>
<a id="I83"><h2>Vitamin D</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that studies show that vitamin&nbsp;D defi&shy;ciency signi&shy;ficant&shy;ly worsens the course of COVID diseases. And that the pre&shy;scrip&shy;tion of vitamin&nbsp;D alone promises massive success in preven&shy;tion and treat&shy;ment!</p>
<a id="I84"><h2>Fact checkers biased</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many fact checkers on the Corona issue are not driven by the truth, but by interests. And that they there&shy;fore are the real life equivalent of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's "1984"!</p>
<a id="I85"><h2>People always die</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that death is the only cer&shy;tainty in life. And that a painful death, as it is regu&shy;larly reported in the media right now in connec&shy;tion with Corona, was also the norm in the time before Corona.</p>
<a id="I86"><h2>Postponed OPs</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that millions of sche&shy;duled OPs have been post&shy;poned world&shy;wide, and people in general have fore&shy;gone medical checks and treat&shy;ments out of fear. And that this has led to much more premature suffering and death.</p>
<a id="I87"><h2>Lockdowns ineffec&shy;tive</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that measures such as lock&shy;downs and school closures have had and continue to have no effect on Corona infection inci&shy;dence. And that, in contrast, these are causing more and more suffe&shy;ring and death in other areas.</p>
<a id="I88"><h2>Staying Alive not Living</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>  that we are losing sight of living for staying alive. And that the currently imposed measures like lockdowns and curfews falsely suggest to people that staying alive equals living.</p>
<a id="I89"><h2>Vaccine there too fast</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the development of working mRNA vaccines for Corona started much too early and has been successful far too quickly compared to previous experiences. And that this should be cause for very critical consideration!</p>
<a id="I90"><h2>1984</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the current situation is very reminiscent of the dystopia "1984" by George Orwell. And that it was certainly not meant to be an template or instruction manual!</p>
<a id="I91"><h2>Vacci&shy;nation senseless</h2></a>
<p>They say <i> in all seriousness</i> that a vacci&shy;nation makes little sense, since among other things its effectiveness is not known and already infected persons do not need it at all. And that the vacci&shy;nation brings us no step closer to a normalization of our lives.</p>
<a id="I92"><h2>Guinea Pigs</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the inade&shy;quate testing of the vaccines, their forced fast-track approval, and the already known adverse effects only suggest that the current mass vacci&shy;nation is an irrespon&shy;sible human experi&shy;ment.</p>
<a id="I93"><h2>Not about health</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our politics is neither concerned about our health nor about our health&shy;care system, since it would have acted comple&shy;tely different otherwise today and in the last decades!</p>
<a id="I94"><h2>Artists stand up</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that more and more artists are remind&shy;ing themselves on their role as critical commen&shy;tators on our world. And that Eric Clapton and Van Morrison are parti&shy;cularly note&shy;worthy in this regard!</p>
<a id="I95"><h2>Herd Immunity Criteria</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that beginning with the Corona vaccination, the WHO has changed its definition of herd immunity so that natural immunity no longer has any meaning. And that it therefore can only be achieved through vaccination.</p>
<a id="I96"><h2>First vaccination victims</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> yet all seriousness</i> that there are already first victims of the vaccination, which are barely covered in the mass media. And that this was predic&shy;table given the rush in which the vaccines were developed and tested.</p>
<a id="I97"><h2>We all get chipped</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the ultimate goal of intro&shy;ducing a worldwide vacci&shy;nation regime is to bring all people under control via micro-chips. And that this will also involve ubiquitous net&shy;working with 5G.</p>
<a id="I98"><h2>Won't go away</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that corona finally has to be considered as just another of many infectious diseases we humans have to live with. And that there are simply no measures to make it disappear again.</p>
<a id="I99"><h2>Oath of Hippo&shy;crates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that physicians commit themselves according to the Oath of Hippocrates not to harm their patients. And that for this reason alone they would have to reject the measures because of their harmfulness.</p>
<a id="I100"><h2>My Body my Choice</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that each incenteridual has the right to decide freely over its body. And that this freedom of choice is under threat with the Corona vaccine regime.</p>
<a id="I101"><h2>Virus from the Lab</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is a lot of serious evidence that the virus was made in a lab. And that as part of "gain of function" research, viruses have been purpose&shy;fully made more dangerous for many years.</p>
<a id="I102"><h2>Auto&shy;Immune overreaction</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after vaccination against the virus there is a risk of a life-threatening over&shy;reaction of the immune system on contact with the real pathogen. And that this could make many vacci&shy;nated people victims in the future.</p>
<a id="I103"><h2>Infertility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the spike protein permanently generated in the body after mRNA vaccination could also have an influence on repro&shy;duction. And that therefore the risk of infertility cannot be ruled out.</p>
<a id="I104"><h2>Allergic reactions</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that certain components of the vaccines can cause allergic reactions. And that this can have potene&shy;tially fatal conse&shy;quences for some people.</p>
<a id="I105"><h2>Risk of genetic alterations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the mRNA administered with some vaccines carries the risk of being incorporated into human genome. And that this effect has also long been used in genetic modification of plants via transgenes.</p>
<a id="I106"><h2>Not a true placebo</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the placebos administered to the comparison groups in vaccine test runs typically also contains most components of the vaccine itself. And that in this way the results are deliberately falsified.</p>
<a id="I107"><h2>How do you tell your children?</h2></a>
<p>They do ask<i> in all seriousness</i> if you are clear about the dystopian future you would be leaving your own children and grandchildren by inaction. And what you want to answer them when they ask why you allowed this to happen?</p>
<a id="I108"><h2>What about Belarus?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Belarus has decided against lockdowns and other measures, contrary to IMF requirements. And that everyday life there has continued as normal and no medical crisis has erupted.</p>
<a id="I109"><h2>Recession already here</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the greatest recession of modern times is already in full swing. And that this damage is not due to the virus but to inappropriate policy decisions around the world.</p>
<a id="I110"><h2>Double Standards</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many double standards, e.g. for sports, the police, railroads and airplanes are an unmistakable sign of large-scale misdirection. And that all you have to do is look closely!</p>
<a id="I111"><h2>Good and bad protests</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state authority intervenes world-wide completely obviously mostly with unpleasant protests, e.g. by punishing offences against distancing and mask obligations. And that they completely ridicule them&shy;selves with that.</p>
<a id="I112"><h2>Virus Patents</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that not only has research on corona&shy;viruses been going on for years with government funds, but that there are even patents on virus variants. And that these patents are held by US government organi&shy;zations.</p>
<a id="I113"><h2>It's not a vaccine</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that "vaccine" is a legally defined term in health law. And that mRNA in a fat coat that causes human cells to produce pathogens does not fall under that definition - which makes all whats currently happening illegal.</p>
<a id="I114"><h2>Füllmich sues ...</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a global team of lawyers led by consumer protection attorney Rainer Füllmich will soon end the crisis by taking all those responsible to courts worldwide!</p>
<a id="I115"><h2>Third Wave is the Jab</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is countless evidence that people often test positive, fall ill and even die for the virus immediately after vaccination. And that a third wave could also be created in this way.</p>
<a id="I116"><h2>Virus not isolated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus has still not been isolated as required by Koch's postulates. And that this alone should be enough to stop the whole thing immediately.</p>
<a id="I117"><h2>Vaccinated further contagious</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccinated persons, according to official data, can continue the virus to pass on to others. And that this measure therefore cannot be a way out of the official crisis.</p>
<a id="I118"><h2>The App in Moscow</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who wants to see what dystopian conditions we've reached, should only look at the Russian quarantine monitoring app - where machines are already monitoring people in captivity.</p>
<a id="I119"><h2>Gibraltar after vaccination</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the numbers in Gibraltar show quite clearly that it was only when vaccination began that a massive wave of disease set in. And that this is evidence enough that vaccination is for entirely different purposes.</p>
<a id="I120"><h2>Upward redistribution</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide states and economies are being forced to sell off possessions, companies and shares via the lockdowns. And that this will lead to a huge wave of redistribution, allowing big business and hedge funds to convert their wealth.</p>
<a id="I121"><h2>45 cycles is a crime</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it was and is PCR testing practice in many countries to consider ct cycles of 35-45 still as positive. And since this range allows no meaningful conclusions about an infection, it can only be considered as a crime.</p>
<a id="I122"><h2>Pharma: Healthy people?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the confidence of many in the vaccine manufacturers is completely naive. And that whoever believes that the pharmaceutical industry wants healthy people also believes that the defense industry wants world peace.</p>
<a id="I123"><h2>Symptoms not unique</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Covid disease has no unique symptoms distinguishable from countless other respiratory diseases at all. And that this way in many countries, without testing, everyone is simply added to the Covid statistics.</p>
<a id="I124"><h2>Vitamin C</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vitamin C has been shown to reduce the propensity for oxidative stress, cytokine storm, and thrombosis in viral infections. And that therefore viral diseases such as COVID-19 should be treated with high-dose vitamin C therapy.</p>
<a id="I125"><h2>Original virus nonexistant</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus of origin, Sars-Cov-2, has already ceased to exist since the fall of 2020, and only mutations of it remained. And that the current media representation has nothing at all to do with this reality.</p>
<a id="I126"><h2>Lockdowns unprecedented</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the measure of economic lockdowns to contain a pandemic has never even been considered before Wuhan. And that there remains no robust evidence that it is effective, but countless that it causes untold suffering.</p>
<a id="I127"><h2>Mutants billion-dollar business</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus mutants now regularly discussed in the media will provide pharmaceutical companies with permanent billions in revenue in the future from ever new vaccines and tests. And that this is not a medical necessity!</p>
<a id="I128"><h2>Dues will rise</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis will really get going when the state and insurance companies make up for their financial losses by raising taxes and contributions. And that this will again only burden the middle class.</p>
<a id="I129"><h2>Politicians above the law</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many cases in which politicians and officials themselves have flouted the rules they have imposed are a clear sign that they themselves do not believe in the propagated dangerousness either.</p>
<a id="I130"><h2>Death certificates falsified</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that covid death statistics are massively inflated by manipulating death certificates in many countries. And that this manipulation is motivated by systemic pressures and incentives.</p>
<a id="I131"><h2>Zanzibar / Tanzania</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the country of Tanzania, which has taken no anti-viral measures, shows that the crisis has no threatening medical dimension. And that ongoing tourism there is the best proof for this.</p>
<a id="I132"><h2>Masks a Torture Tool</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the forced wearing of surgical masks is an instrument of torture. And that at Guantanamo it is used to terrorize all inmates through diminished oxygenation and sensory deprivation.</p>
<a id="I133"><h2>Home office makes lonely</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that forced distancing, for example by working in home office, makes people lonely and triggers mental illnesses. And that unstable and sensitive people in particular are among the victims.</p>
<a id="I134"><h2>New normal permanently</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the "New Normality" is not something temporary but a permanently changed world. And that this also emerges unmistakably from the statements of those responsible.</p>
<a id="I135"><h2>Cracking down on critics</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide the executive is rigorously cracking down on critical activists, doctors and lawyers. And that in doing so, means in the legal gray area and also clearly unlawful means are being used.</p>
<a id="I136"><h2>Vaccination favors mutations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the new vaccines do not achieve sterile immunity and vaccinated people thus continue to be contagious, the emergence of new viral mutations is massively favored. And that this has not been sufficiently considered!</p>
<a id="I137"><h2>Politicians just our employees</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that our politicians were elected by us to enforce the interests of us as citizens. And that if they don't do what we want, we have to fire them - that's democracy!</p>
<a id="I138"><h2>Digital vaccination ID coming</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the digital, worldwide valid vaccination card for all is just being fast-tracked. And that once it's there, it will be used as a legitimization for discriminating against people.</p>
<a id="I139"><h2>Fourth estate missing</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the media is the fourth estate in society, which has the role of critically accompanying the rulers. And that currently, without serious criticism, we lack this corrective.</p>
<a id="I140"><h2>Influencers harnessed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many celebrities and influencers are not accidentally using their reach to spread the Corona narrative, but are part of a well-organized propaganda campaign!</p>
<a id="I141"><h2>Vaccination increases mortality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that mortality rates worldwide have been rising since vaccination campaigns began. And that it can no longer be covered up that the experimental vaccines are to blame!</p>
<a id="I142"><h2>Israel Human Lab</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that in Israel, since vaccination, the risk of death is hundreds of times higher compared to the disease, especially among young people. And that the country can only be considered a big human laboratory!</p>
<a id="I143"><h2>There is no "the science"</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is no single "the science" in the sense of "the truth". Science relies on hypothesis, experiment, validation or falsification. And that whoever uses the term in this way has not understood the principles of science and is instead inclined to scientism.</p>
<a id="I144"><h2>What about Florida?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Florida never had mandatory masks, the beaches were never closed, and since September 2020 all kids have been going to school normally. And that even so, fewer people have died from Corona than the U.S. average.</p>
<a id="I145"><h2>What about North and South Dakota?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that North and South Dakota had the same pandemic development, even though stringent measures were imposed in one part and none at all in the other. And that that is evidence enough that the measures are ineffective.</p>
<a id="I146"><h2>What about Texas?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the governor of Texas repealed the lockdown and all Corona measures in March 2021. And that the fact that it hasn't had any effect on the already low casualty numbers since then shows the general futility of these regulatory interventions.</p>
<a id="I147"><h2>Pollutants in masks/tests</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that toxic substances and harmful materials have been found in corona masks and also on the sticks of test kits. And that you would only harm yourself if you used these things.</p>
<a id="I148"><h2>Nuremberg Laws</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide partially forced vaccination with experimental, sparely tested substances violates the Nuremberg Laws, because people are clearly being abused as guinea pigs here, as they were then.</p>
<a id="I149"><h2>Second Nuremberg Trials</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that thousands of lawyers worldwide are preparing trials comparable to the Nuremberg Trials. And that we are dealing with crimes against humanity in both the Corona swindle and the vaccine experiments.</p>
<a id="I150"><h2>Vaccine apartheid</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the measure to grant more rights to the vaccinated than to the unvaccinated, which is currently being pushed by politicians worldwide, is a clearly unlawful discrimination. And that excesses of this discrimination in some countries are already tantamount to a kind of apartheid.</p>
<a id="I151"><h2>Digital vaccination card dystopian</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Digital Vaccination Card, which is being established worldwide at full pace, leads directly to an authoritarian dystopia, since it can be very easily technically advanced into a Chinese-style social credit system.</p>
<a id="I152"><h2>Discourse deliberately poisoned</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the public and scientific discourse around the Corona issue is being deliberately sabotaged by media and influence agents. And that to this end, critics are not only defamed and labeled, but also damaged and their very existence threatened.</p>
<a id="I153"><h2>Not proportio&shy;nate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is a legal principle that measures intended to achieve a legitimate purpose must be suitable, necessary and proportionate. And that this consideration was never properly carried out for the current Corona measures.</p>
<a id="I154"><h2>Positive is not infected</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that PCR tests, nor any of the other tests currently in use, can detect a viral infection. And that therefore publicly referring to those who test positive as "newly infected" or their numbers as "incidence" is completely misleading.</p>
<a id="I155"><h2>Doctors have tunnel view</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that doctors are ill-suited to be witnesses to the crisis, since they are confronted only with illness, suffering, and death, and do not always overlook the reasons for their situation.</p>
<a id="I156"><h2>Children not drivers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that children, because of their typically strong immune systems, put respiratory viruses away well and don't get sick very often. And that they therefore can't be drivers of a pandemic and are unnecessarily overrun with measures.</p>
<a id="I157"><h2>Testing unnecessary</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that undergoing a Corona test as a healthy person is completely unnecessary. And that whoever does a test to know if he is sick, probably also goes regularly to the cemetery to know if he is already dead.</p>
<a id="I158"><h2>Not exponential</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the epidemic spread of a viral disease just does not proceed exponentially but decays very quickly in the form of a bell curve. And that the decreasing number of potential hosts and their ever increasing immunity contributes to this.</p>
<a id="I159"><h2>Long Flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the proportion of long-term sequelae in covid disease is as high as in influenza, at about 5%. And that we are not dealing with a specificity of this disease, just as we are with other symptoms, such as loss of the olfactory sense.</p>
<a id="I160"><h2>Nothing learned</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after the fascism experiences in Europe one wanted to prevent a repetition by comprehensive enlightenment in the school. And that these efforts were in vain, because right at the first global fascist coup the majority of the population falls for the old patterns again.</p>
<a id="I161"><h2>Bill Gates no mask</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Bill Gates has never been seen wearing a mask. And that this is a clear indication of who is really pulling the strings.</p>
<a id="I162"><h2>Vaccination is gene therapy</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Corona vaccinations are a never-before-approved gene therapy intervention on humans. And that the name "vaccination" was chosen only because it is positively associated with most people.</p>
<a id="I163"><h2>Adverse effects not reported</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the adverse effects rate is heavily skewed because most adverse effects, especially deaths, are not even recorded. And that many studies suggest that this reporting rate is in the single digits.</p>
<a id="I164"><h2>Vaccine shedding</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination are harmful substances that are excreted by the body of vaccinated persons. And that in this way they can also harm unvaccinated people in their vicinity.</p>
<a id="I165"><h2>Covid vascular disease</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Covid is actually a vascular disease in which the immune response to the spike proteins of the viral envelope interferes with oxygen transport in the lungs, for example. And that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination could exacerbate this effect.</p>
<a id="I166"><h2>Thrombosis due to spike proteins</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the spike proteins permanently produced in the body after vaccination are harmful substances that lead to thrombosis through immune reaction. And that here the long-term effects, which have not been investigated, could lead to fatal consequences for those vaccinated.</p>
<a id="I167"><h2>Vaccinating children crime</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a red line has been crossed by trying to enforce vaccination of children as well. And that children are at a much higher risk from vaccination than from the disease itself.</p>
<a id="I168"><h2>Vaccinating Placebo Luck</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that with that the happiness and liberation that many feel after vaccination is only the falling away of their irrational fear. And that one can only hope that none of the lucky ones will come down with severe adverse effects in the months or years to come.</p>
<a id="I169"><h2>Gurgling is enough</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that regular gargling with appropriate means would be completely sufficient to prevent the virus already from the entrance into the own body. And that all the measures and also the vaccination would be superfluous if everyone did that.</p>
<a id="I170"><h2>Deaths added up</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the ever-increasing numbers of covid victims are due to the fact that they are not recounted seasonally as with the flu, but added up as individual waves a large "pandemic". And that by splitting them up, you would be back to the dimensions of the flu.</p>
<a id="I171"><h2>Mistreatment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a large proportion of the covid deaths would have been preventable if they had been treated early and properly. And that this is partly because well-studied and effective drugs like hydroxychloroquine or ivermecin would be suppressed in parts of the world.</p>
<a id="I172"><h2>Conspiracy theories true</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many of the critics' predictions, such as the introduction of a digital vaccination card or even mandatory vaccination, which were initially dismissed as nonsense, have now come true. And that people just aren't looking closely enough to notice.</p>
<a id="I173"><h2>New way of counting</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide, through regulatory and statistical sleight of hand, attempts are being made to portray the vaccination campaign as a success. And that everyone who looks at this should actually be able to see through this.</p>
<a id="I174"><h2>Vaccination site magnetic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many vaccinated people found that their upper arm is now magnetic at the injection site. And since this effect cannot be explained with the official contents materials of the vaccines, we with the vaccination apparently are fooled.</p>
<a id="I175"><h2>Like "The Wave"</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the behavior of the majority of people in crisis is very much like that of the students in the well-known movie "The Wave." And that the lessons learned in the film can be directly applied to our current reality.</p>
<a id="I176"><h2>No sterile immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that none of the vaccines approved against the virus achieve sterile immunity, after which infection of others is no longer possible. And that therefore linking "relaxations" to vaccination is completely pointless.</p>
<a id="I177"><h2>AIDS segments in the virus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the genome of the virus has been shown to contain distinctive segments of the AIDS virus. And that this is so unlikely that this fact can be taken as evidence that the virus was created by the so-called gene scissors in the lab.</p>
<a id="I178"><h2>Vaccine damage-dark figure high</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that already always with vaccinations only 1-10% of the adverse effect and death cases are reported. And that even in the case of this virus, there is a demonstrably large number of unreported cases, and a large proportion of these reactions go under the radar.</p>
<a id="I179"><h2>Trans-Humanism Agenda</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one of the big agendas behind the crisis is that of so-called transhumanisnus, which stands for a merging of man and machine. And that its elitist proponents envision the immortality of their own souls as a distant goal.</p>
<a id="I180"><h2>The virus is a hoax</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all the fuss about the virus is its supposed dangerousness a single hoax, serving the worldwide enforcement of other big plans. And that this will also soon become apparent.</p>
<a id="I181"><h2>Will endure the virus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that their personal immune systems are strong enough to withstand an illness with the virus without damage. And that they therefore not only do not take the measures seriously a vaccination is out of the question for them.</p>
<a id="I182"><h2>Only Emergency Admissions</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all vaccines worldwide have only a limited emergency approval, which does not justify the careless vaccination of a large part of the world's population at all. And that this approval would be null and void the moment the pandemic was declared over.</p>
<a id="I183"><h2>Won't stop at 1x</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if you think you are out of responsibility with one round of vaccination, you have miscalculated. And that it is already foreseeable that one's own vaccination, with all its risks, will have to be renewed at least every year.</p>
<a id="I184"><h2>"Gain of Function" research</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that research has been going on for decades with government money into using corona and other viruses as bio-weapons. And you can possibly trace the current virus back to this "gain-of-function" research as well, which most recently took place in Wuhan.</p>
<a id="I185"><h2>Triage in child psychiatry</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that while the world is more or less successful in preventing triage for respiratory problems caused by the virus, at the same time there has long been triage for mental health problems, especially in children.</p>
<a id="I186"><h2>Eugenics link</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that links to the eugenics movement can be found not only among Bill Gates but among many other players in the crisis, such as the Moderna developers. And that this is an indication that the global push for mass vaccination may also be about population reduction.</p>
<a id="I187"><h2>Ivermecin</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that great success has been achieved with the malaria drug ivermecin in the treatment of corona sufferers, which has also been proven by studies. And that this drug is nonetheless suppressed in many countries around the world and is not available to doctors for treatment.</p>
<a id="I188"><h2>Hydroxy&shy;chloro&shy;quine</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that hydroxychloroquine is a simple, over-the-counter treatment available almost anywhere in the world for respiratory diseases like corona. And that its widespread use was successfully prevented by the pharmaceutical industry through a rigged study in 2020.</p>
<a id="I189"><h2>Absolute risk reduction</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the absolute risk reduction for all approved vaccines is only in the range of 1%, so they have no effect on the overall population. And that you can prove anything with numbers, if you present them in the appropriate way.</p> 
<a id="I190"><h2>Neofeudalism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that the concentration of wealth among fewer and fewer people has accelerated further with the crisis. And that the unequal power relations that result are already tantamount to a kind of new feudalism.</p>
<a id="I191"><h2>You'll own nothing</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that among the visions formulated for the period after the Great Reset 2015 is the happy renunciation of property for the 99%. And that the 1% super-rich are excluded here, of course.</p>
<a id="I192"><h2>Klaus Schwab</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that just a few months after the crisis began, World Economic Forum chief Klaus Schwab has already laid out in a book how it must be urgently used as a unique "window of opportunity" to implement the changes in the world that the powerful now believe are called for.</p>
<a id="I193"><h2>Young Global Leaders</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the World Economic Forum has long trained top politicians in its Young Global Leaders program to advance its interests worldwide. And that from this cadre comes not only the current German Chancellor Merkel, but also the upcoming Chancellor Baerbock!</p>
<a id="I194"><h2>Stakeholder Capitalism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the WEF's Great Reset envisions nothing less than the reshaping of the global economy into a stakeholder capitalism dominated by a few large corporations, so that these stakeholders will then take responsibility for resources and environmental protection.</p>
<a id="I195"><h2>Next: climate change</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that the Great Reset, by being a concentration of economic power in a few stakeholders, should also solve the responsibility problem of global climate change. And that every individual will soon also have to reckon with repressive restrictions on freedom in favor of the climate.</p>
<a id="I196"><h2>Protests hushed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that most people are unaware of the massive opposition to the Corona agenda, as ongoing protests of several hundred thousand people worldwide, for example in Berlin or London, are simply downplayed, defamed, or kept quiet altogether by the media.</p>
<a id="I197"><h2>Seasonality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the corona virus is also a virus that is only seasonally active, and that the much-cited "waves" can be explained as seasonal waves. And that it is therefore misleading to keep adding up the victims of these waves.</p>
<a id="I198"><h2>Bio-weapons deployments?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they can certainly imagine that some outbreaks since the beginning of the crisis could be traced to the use of the virus as a bioweapon. And that if so, the conspirators would have all the means in hand to maintain fear and states of emergency until their plans were implemented.</p>
<a id="I199"><h2>mRNA nanoparticles</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA vaccines are injected in lipid nanoparticles, typically SM-102. And that these nanoparticles are highly dangerous and not intended for human use at all.</p>
<a id="I200"><h2>Insolvencies</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that countless companies around the world have been driven into insolvency by lockdowns. And that these bankruptcies threaten the livelihoods of many more people than the virus ever could. And that the effects have been delayed in some countries by changes in the law.</p>
<a id="I201"><h2>Agenda Unstoppable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that those elites who are pursuing their own hidden agenda with the fake viral crisis have no other option at all but to keep pushing it. And that if people were to figure it out, they would face exposure and prosecution.</p>
<a id="I202"><h2>US states without action</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in a large part of the especially Republican US states no measures apply anymore or never did. And that there are no negative effects to be observed there, which should raise critical questions in the rest of the world about their own policy on measures.</p>
<a id="I203"><h2>Masks and occupational safety</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in many countries recommended or even required professional dust masks may only be used for short periods of time and with breaks according to current occupational health and safety rules. And that these rules play virtually no role in public communication.</p>
<a id="I204"><h2>20 years of adverse effects</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all vaccines used worldwide have caused far fewer adverse effects and deaths in the last 20 years combined than the Corona vaccines have caused in a few months. And that, unfortunately, all security mechanisms are failing here.</p>
<a id="I205"><h2>Intellectuals silent</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the vast majority of artists and intellectuals have failed to understand the threat to their and humanity's future posed by the staged crisis. And that they have remained silent for fear of going viral or being ostracized by society.</p>
<a id="I206"><h2>Social Credit System Coming</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that policymakers around the world are looking to the Chinese model to keep the population in check. And that solutions like the digital immunization card are right along the lines of China's social credit system.</p>
