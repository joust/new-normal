<h1>The<i> Sheeple</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="S1"><h2>What about Bergamo?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in Bergamo, Italy were completely overloaded in March, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S2"><h2>What about New York?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in New York were completely overburdened in April, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S3"><h2>Flatten the Curve!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if infection rates rise, we need these measures to flatten the curve again. And that otherwise our health system will inevitably be overloaded to the detriment of all!</p>
<a id="S4"><h2>Prevent triage</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if the health care system is overloaded, the staff will eventually be forced to prefer patients to others in triage because they can no longer treat all of them. And that this must be prevented under all circumstances!</p>
<a id="S5"><h2>Coffins stacking</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everywhere where the virus has really broken out, the coffins have piled up near the hospitals. And that the military had to help with the transport!</p>
<a id="S6"><h2>Exponen&shy;tial!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, as soon as the curve of the infected begins to rise exponentially, one must assume a continuation in exponential form. And that therefore drastic measures for the containment are justified!</p>
<a id="S7"><h2>It's only a mask</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing a mask according to the guidelines would be a negligible sacrifice to protect everyone. And that they cannot understand the criticism of this at all.</p>
<a id="S8"><h2>Aerosols</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is transmitted via aerosols e.g. by breathing, speaking and singing, even if the person concerned does not have any symptoms. And that wearing masks helps to prevent these aerosols from spreading.</p>
<a id="S9"><h2>Even the young die</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that young people are also affected to a relevant extent by severe courses or even death from the virus. And that we cannot therefore rely on not belonging to the risk group.</p>
<a id="S10"><h2>Nature strikes back</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as human beings are to blame for the crisis, because we have thoughtlessly destroyed nature and thus our own habitat in the past. And that nature now just strikes back.</p>
<a id="S11"><h2>Corona Parties</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that when people celebrate, dance and relax together, it contributes to a dangerous spread of the virus. And that we therefore have to avoid these things in the future.</p>
<a id="S12"><h2>Our planet recovers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns are good for the planet. That air and water pollution will decrease when tourism, cruises and aviation are no longer available. And that it would therefore be nice if this could simply continue to be handled in the same way.</p>
<a id="S13"><h2>Long-term con&shy;sequences</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after such a short time, nothing can be said about the long-term consequences of the new viral disease. And that it is therefore justified that people continue to be as careful as possible and follow the decreed measures.</p>
<a id="S14"><h2>We still know so little</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because one knows too little about the virus and its dangerousness after such a short time, it is justified to demand some privations from the people first. And that only when one has sufficiently examined the virus and found it to be of little risk, one can start life up again.</p>
<a id="S15"><h2>Politi&shy;cians play it safe</h2></a>

<a id="S17"><h2>Can think for myself</h2></a>

<a id="S18"><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that an overly critical attitude and, in particular, evidence that motives other than our health may be at play, all of which are conspiracy theories and should not be further investi&shy;gated.</p>
<a id="S19"><h2>Sweden death rate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that due to the higher death rate the "Swedish way", i.e. the renuncia&shy;tion of lockdowns and emergency decrees, would not be an option for the rest of the world. And that those who demand it simply want to accept more victims.</p>
<a id="S20"><h2>Trump position</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, when Donald Trump, as the clown of an U.S. president, expresses critical and erroneous views on the virus or the measures, that one should not adopt any of these positions. And that having the same views as Trump always puts you on the wrong side!</p>
<a id="S21"><h2>Immunity does not last</h2></a>
<p>They say <i> in all seriousness</i> that antibodies to the Corona virus have not been detected for COVID patients shortly after their illness! And that one must therefore assume that herd immunity will not occur naturally.</p>
<a id="S22"><h2>Not a virologist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that virolo&shy;gists are the ones who can best assess all, including social, epi&shy;demio&shy;logical and medical aspects of the current virus crisis and the measures decreed. And that it is therefore best to listen to them instead of any others.</p>
<a id="S23"><h2>Protect others</h2></a>

<a id="S24"><h2>Listen to experts</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experts currently heard almost everywhere in the world who advocate lock&shy;downs and emergency ordinances are the only experts to listen to. And that other views would not matter.</p>

<a id="S26"><h2>Real Risk group</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because they or their friends or relatives belong to the risk group being concerned is justified. And that it is therefore under&shy;stand&shy;able not to be open to arguments against the measures.</p>
<a id="S27"><h2>Puts everyone in danger</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who oppose the currently suspended democratic procedures, lockdowns and emer&shy;gency decrees, e.g. through demons&shy;trations, are the ones who endanger all others. And that this right should best be taken away from them as well.</p>

<a id="S29"><h2>Children very contagious</h2></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, accor&shy;ding to the John Snow Memo&shy;randum, the morta&shy;lity rate (IFR) from COVID is much higher than that of an influenza, that there are also long-lasting COVID symp&shy;toms and that it's unclear how long immunity lasts. And that there&shy;fore the measures are appro&shy;priate and reason&shy;able.</p>
<a id="S36"><h2>Numbers low THANKS to Lockdown</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that infection rates have dropped again because the lockdown was so successful. And that it is an effective tool for containment not to be criticised.</p>
<a id="S37"><h2>What would you do?</h2></a>

<a id="S38"><h2>What freedoms?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they would not understand what freedoms the critics miss so much! And that they can be glad to be allowed to demons&shy;trate, although they don't even adhere to imposed conditions!</p>
<a id="S39"><h2>What basic rights?</h2></a>

<a id="S43"><h2>Not compar&shy;able</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that you can not and may not statistically compare the current crisis with flu situations of the past, because this time the majority has behaved very cautiously! And that this caution has certainly pushed the numbers massively down.</p>
<a id="S44"><h2>Popula&shy;tion density</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experien&shy;ces like in Sweden do not help us, because it is hardly inhabited land. And that the rest of Europe is not!</p>
<a id="S45"><h2>Question of per&shy;spective</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that someone who has dealt directly with suffering and death in the context of a virus inevitably has a completely different perspec&shy;tive than someone who has only dealt with numbers and curves. And that it is therefore better to show more humility!</p>

<a id="S51"><h2>Signal of solidarity</h2></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that isolating people of risk groups and not letting them participate in life is not an option. And that such a demand would be unethical!</p>
<a id="S53"><h2>Pregnant women at risk</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that pregnant women have a weaker immune system and therefore also are a risk group. And that we should therefore stick to the measures also for the best possible protection of pregnant women!</p>

<a id="S75"><h2>No False Positives</h2></a>

<a id="S80"><h2>More dange&shy;rous than flu</h2></a>

<a id="S87"><h2>Unre&shy;corded Cases</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many people fall ill with Corona and also suffer long time damage without it even being recorded in any statistics. And that therefore looking at the data alone does not allow for a valid evaluation of the crisis!</p>
<a id="S88"><h2>Lockdowns work</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns work. And that, for example, the radical lockdown in Ireland in October, including a movement radius of 5 km, was very effective. And that we would only have to follow this pattern for a few weeks to finally overcome the virus.</p>
<a id="S89"><h2>Herd Immunity no option</h2></a>

<a id="S102"><h2>Asymptomatic transmission</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are sufficient cases where we know of infection with the virus without there being symptoms of illness: and that this just makes it reasonable for us all to wear masks until we can protect ourselves with vaccine or medication.</p>
<a id="S103"><h2>Politicians simply incompetent</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many of the measures pursued worldwide to contain the virus are unsuitable is not intentional but simply due to incompetence of the politicians. And that this has always been the case in other areas as well.</p>
<a id="S104"><h2>Politician groupthink</h2></a>

<a id="S106"><h2>Number of Fates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they can deduce the threatening nature of the new virus solely from the fact that they observe many more fates of illness and death in their own environment than in earlier years. And that this is probably a good indicator.</p>  
<a id="S107"><h2>Doctors don't cheat</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they consider it inconceivable that doctors and nursing staff falsify death certificates en masse because of financial incentives. And that one must be able to rely on the medical ethos here!</p>
<a id="S108"><h2>Immunity only with vaccine</h2></a>

<a id="S109"><h2>Not jeopardize what's been achieved</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is still with us and even if we have much lower numbers again, the measures should be preserved because loosening them too soon will always throw us back again to square one!</p>
<a id="S110"><h2>Home office great thing</h2></a>

<a id="S114"><h2>B.1.1.7 Mutation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the British mutation is highly contagious compared to the original virus. And that this means more infected people, more severe courses of disease, and more deaths!</p>
<a id="S115"><h2>B.1.351 Mutation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the South African mutation is better at tricking the human immune system. And that vaccines might be less effective, and that after surviving covid-19, you could re-infect yourself with this variant!</p>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Amazon mutation P1 is three times more contagious than the original virus. And that it is responsible for the catastrophic conditions in Manaus, Brazil!</p>
<a id="S117"><h2>Immune Escape</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that viral mutations with the E484K genetic variant are more dangerous because they evade the protective effects of the human immune system by preventing already-formed antibodies from docking.</p>

<a id="S120"><h2>Next wave coming</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if the numbers fall or are low, easing the measures is too dangerous because it could trigger the next wave at any time. And that calling for such things is irresponsible!</p>
<a id="S121"><h2>Immune system not enough</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is so tricky that sometimes your immune system is not able to fight it off. And that that's why it's not just people with weak immune systems who get sick and die.</p>

<a id="S123"><h2>Israel successful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the vaccination campaign in Israel is a complete success, preventing both the disease and further contagions there. And that herd immunity has almost been achieved in the country.</p>
<a id="S124"><h2>AIDS also under&shy;estimated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that AIDS was also not properly assessed in its early stages. And that many additional victims had to be mourned before those affected took the risk seriously and protected themselves.</p>
<a id="S125"><h2>Measures: everyone healthier</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that drastic statistical decreases in all other respiratory diseases can only be seen as a success of the measures. Masks and social distancing are making us all healthier, and for that they have already paid off.</p>
<a id="S126"><h2>Smarter than the rest?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> if you think you're smarter than the whole rest of the world with your views on the crisis? And how you can be so sure of your facts and your conclusions?</p>

<a id="S128"><h2>Vaccine egoism real problem</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that rich countries take advantage to get enough vaccine doses faster than the rest of the world. And that this injustice is the real problem!</p>
<a id="S129"><h2>Business lobbying prolonges</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that businesses, with their lobbyists, keep interfering in politics and watering or preventing effective measures. And that we, like other countries, would have been through the crisis long ago without these interventions.</p>
<a id="S130"><h2>FLICC principle</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Corona-critical positions are FLICC, taken only by pseudo-experts mostly unfamiliar with the subject, based on disinformation and full of logical errors. And that instead one should only follow real experts.</p>
<a id="S131"><h2>Why masks in surgeries?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, if masks don't help, why do surgeons wear them during their surgeries? From this fact alone one could deduce that these masks are at least partially effective against viruses.</p>
<a id="S132"><h2>Researchers are heroes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the researchers behind the vaccine development are real heroes who deserved their awards. And that without them, we would have had many more victims to mourn and would have had to endure the pandemic for much longer.</p>
<a id="S133"><h2>Bill Gates Philanthropist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, Bill Gates is being attacked completely unjustly, because he has unselfishly devoted his wealth to medical progress, thus taking humanity further with his foundation than anyone else.</p>
<a id="S134"><h2>Vaccination Little Sacrifice</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that getting vaccinated is the contribution of each and every one of us to ridding the world of the pandemic. And that the minimal risk of adverse effects associated with it is, after all, a small sacrifice compared to the chance for everyone to return to normal life.</p>
<a id="S135"><h2>Digital Vaccination Card Solution</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because we can only defeat the pandemic if as many people as possible are vaccinated, the digital vaccination card will help us as a ticket and thus motivator to get closer to that goal as quickly as possible.</p>
<a id="S136"><h2>Millions dead</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if measures like lockdowns and curfews had not been taken worldwide, we would have had millions more dead. And that the model calculations on which these predictions are based were worked out by reliable scientists.</p>
<a id="S137"><h2>Big Pharma Indispensable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as a human race wouldn't be where we are now without the huge risks the pharmaceutical industry takes in developing medical therapies. And that these companies are valued far too little.</p>
<a id="S138"><h2>Masks harmless</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing masks should not cause any health problems to healthy children and adults. And that for exceptional cases a mask exemption certificate can always be presented.</p>
<a id="S139"><h2>Virus fatal worldwide</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide, at many sites of infection, the uncontrolled spread of the virus has caused catastrophic conditions. And that the measures taken elsewhere have been precisely successful in suppressing that spread.</p>
<a id="S140"><h2>What about India?</h2></a>

<a id="S141"><h2>Vitamin D unproven</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is not proven whether vitamin D is suitable for preventing severe covid progression. And that here one rather runs the risk of overdosing the vitamin and getting undesirable side effects like kidney stones.</p>
<a id="S142"><h2>PCR tests reliable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the PCR test procedure is proven and has a high reliability documented by many studies. And that dubious findings are usually backed by testing additional gene sections.</p>
<a id="S143"><h2>Prevention Paradox</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that the success of preventive measures makes people lose their sense of danger. Moreover, since they do little for the individual, acceptance of both the measures - and for the all-important vaccination - suffers.</p>
<a id="S144"><h2>Unvaccinated will be sick</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the people who don't get vaccinated are very likely to end up with Covid, since the virus has few carriers left. And that the unvaccinated will thus be responsible for the pandemic to not end.</p>
<a id="S145"><h2>Gurgling does little</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the assumption that you can protect yourself from contracting the virus by gargling or other home remedies would be a false one. And that such medical misinformation can be life-threatening.</p>
<a id="S146"><h2>Vaccination of children unavoidable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccinating even children is unavoidable to end the pandemic. And that it is, after all, also a question of generational justice that children also get access to the vaccines.</p>
<a id="S147"><h2>Vaccine Shedding Nonsense</h2></a>

<a id="S148"><h2>Vaccinating gives vitality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination has given them back strength and vitality. And that since then, they've had a sense of lightness that feels so good, they're recommending others get vaccinated soon, too.</p>

<a id="S150"><h2>Vaccinating means love</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that getting vaccinated is a matter of solidarity with one's fellow man after all. And that the prospect of overcoming the pandemic with joint effort should be enough to undergo this small intervention.</p>
<a id="S151"><h2>Delta Variant Dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Indian variant B1.617 is causing untold suffering in the country of origin and is just spreading worldwide. And that this clearly shows that even at low incidences, neither the pandemic is over nor the risk to individuals is negligible.</p>
<a id="S152"><h2>Telegram dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Russian messenger Telegram, on which criminals and Nazis have been cavorting for years, is doubly dangerous: on the one hand, it is not taken data protection serious, on the other hand, nowhere more unedited false information is spread. And that it should therefore not be used under any circumstances.</p>
<a id="S153"><h2>Vaccinated are only malingering</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many people, who announced themselves ill after their inoculation first once for days, are in part only simulators. And that it is tempting to take a few days off after vaccination.</p>
<a id="S154"><h2>Unvaccinated put others at risk</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the end everyone will have to get vaccinated so we can successfully defeat the virus. And that everyone who is re-vaccinated is a permanent threat to everyone else, which can only be countered by isolation.</p>
<a id="S155"><h2>Unvaccinated make mutations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus can not only spread unhindered over the bodies of the unvaccinated but mutate more intensively. And that therefore every unvaccinated person increases the risk that new dangerous mutations will emerge and further prevent our return to normalcy.</p>
<a id="S156"><h2>Half-knowledge dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many critics are completely wrongly sure of their case and their arguments, since they are usually based on only half-knowledge. And that only experts really have the full knowledge that allows an assessment of many issues.</p>
<a id="S157"><h2>Politicians want re-election</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the regulation mania of politicians shooting partly beyond the goal can be explained also simply with the fact that these want to be re-elected evenly gladly. And that they hope to achieve that by creating a sense of security for the majority.</p>
<a id="S158"><h2>Chaos Theory Explains it</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all you need to explain the crisis is chaos theory, not conspiracy theories. And that, in general, the simplest explanation is always the most likely.</p>
<a id="S159"><h2>Many more dead than official</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the dark figure of corona deaths worldwide is most certainly tens of times higher than the official figures suggest. And that one can therefore also assume an umpteen-fold higher risk for all of us.</p>
<a id="S160"><h2>Travel irresponsible</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who are still traveling in the current crisis are behaving highly irresponsibly. And that every traveler carries with them a risk of carrying viruses and viral mutations into or out of other countries.</p>
<a id="S161"><h2>Refuting Bullshit Harder</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the reasonable scientists and journalists are no match for the many, constantly new slanted claims and theories of the critics. And that refuting bullshit requires a power of ten more energy than its production.</p>
<a id="S162"><h2>Protests increase incidence</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many people taking to the streets around the world against the Corona measures are partly to blame for our failure to overcome the pandemic. And that each new protest march without masks and distance increases the incidence again.</p>
<a id="S163"><h2>Zoonotic diseases are on the rise</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mankind operates thoughtless overexploitation of exotic animals, more jumps of pathogens (zoonoses) will occur in the future. And that this is simply a natural "lesson to think about" for us humans.</p>
<a id="S164"><h2>Will endure vaccination</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if vaccination should be problematic, they think their own immune systems are strong enough to put it away. And that the advantages, such as being able to travel again, outweigh the disadvantages after all.</p>
<a id="S165"><h2>Vaxxing for travel</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they do not want the vaccination even necessarily, but if they future otherwise not on journeys would be allowed, they this sacrifice on itself would take. After all, life is short and one should live it to the fullest.</p>
<a id="S166"><h2>Vaccinating protects the weak</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who safely refuses vaccination, even though they have a healthy and strong body, is doing so to the detriment of the weak. For even though the disease may not harm one oneself, it may harm a weaker person whom one might infect.</p>
<a id="S167"><h2>Not yet immune</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that only after the pandemic will it be possible to live tolerably with the virus. And that until then we still have to wait until the vast majority is immune to the virus.</p>
<a id="S168"><h2>Contact tracing solution</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after all the best solution for a future coexistence with the virus with as little risk as possible is consistent contact tracking. And that they therefore advocate the mandatory use of appropriate apps.</p>
<a id="S169"><h2>Information Laziness</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the critics who do not take the crisis seriously are simply too lazy to inform themselves sufficiently. And that this laziness could yet be their undoing.</p>
<a id="S170"><h2>What can be done?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if the critics were right in their theories about the virus, the crisis, and the vaccination, what would be gained from that knowledge? And if it really were a conspiracy of this magnitude, what could one do about it as an individual?</p>
<a id="S171"><h2>Virus natural</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is enough evidence that the virus is of natural origin and came into the world through zoonosis, the jump from an animal to a human. And that claims that it might have come from a lab in Wuhan have no basis.</p>
<a id="S172"><h2>Chinaphobia</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that claims that the virus came from a lab in Wuhan and was deliberately sent into the world by the Chinese government must first be proven. And that spreading it without proof would only fuel hostility toward China and put people at risk.</p>
<a id="S173"><h2>Testing prevents outbreaks</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that this helps the current testing strategy contain the virus, because infected people can be detected and isolated more quickly with all the testing. And that we can also accept the sacrifice of fewer unnecessarily isolated false positives in return.</p>
<a id="S174"><h2>Just money-making</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many lawyers around the world who promise to help people get their rights through lawsuits in matters such as unjust measures are just making money. And that people should think twice about investing their money in such lawsuits.</p>
<a id="S175"><h2>Supervised</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that we are nevertheless already all for corporations and intelligence agencies glass people. And that those who are now painting a surveillance state like in China on the wall have not even realized the current situation yet.</p>
<a id="S176"><h2>Protesting egoists</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all those, which go now without masks and distance on the road, are nevertheless only prosperity spoiled egoists. And that these should better face the reality of the pandemic and subordinate themselves, so that we all get us free life again someday.</p>
<a id="S177"><h2>I just don't believe</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that these whole stories around any bad plans of dark forces are nevertheless only speculations. And that one must always ask oneself the question about the sense. Why should they do that? What would they get out of it?</p>
<a id="S178"><h2>Explainable by profit</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that just about everything that conspiracy theorists want to explain with complicated conspiracies can also be explained simply with profit motive. Currently, for example, it is hundreds of billions in the vaccine and testing business.</p>
<a id="S179"><h2>Ockham's razor</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the principle of Occam's razor, common in science, can also be applied to the current situation: Of several possible explanations for one and the same state of affairs, the simplest theory is preferable to all others.</p>
<a id="S180"><h2>Close the gaps</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if the whole world must be vaccinated to end the pandemic, the rich countries must now scramble to finance vaccines for the poor in Africa and elsewhere. And that this is the only way to close the vaccination gaps!</p>
<a id="S181"><h2>Adverse effects show effectiveness</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the sometimes severe adverse effects that vaccinated people experience after vaccination are a sign that strong immune protection is building up. And that they are therefore an unmistakable sign that the vaccination is having its effect.</p>
<a id="S182"><h2>Vaccination is responsibility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everyone who gets vaccinated is making an important contribution to the common good and society as a whole. And that these people can be proud of themselves for making this small sacrifice for everyone.</p>
<a id="S183"><h2>No rights for the unvaccinated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that since the unvaccinated are shirking their social responsibilities, they shouldn't get back the freedoms that were curtailed to fight the crisis either. And that this is also a strong incentive for them to reconsider their decision.</p>
<a id="S184"><h2>Bill Gates doesn't need money</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many insinuations and conspiracy charges Bill Gates is facing all make no sense after all, because man already has so much money, he doesn't need any more.</p>
<a id="S185"><h2>All WHO claims</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the uniform Corona politics and -measure selection have world-wide their basis in defaults and recommendations of the World Health Organization WHO. And that, therefore, one cannot impute any clandestine intentions to the politicians here.</p>
<a id="S186"><h2>New start urgently needed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Great Reset, as planned by the members of the World Economic Forum, is without alternative after all. And that a new start is urgently needed in many areas in order to preserve our living space for the future.</p>
<a id="S187"><h2>Expropriate Pharmaceutical Patents</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the real problem is that the drug companies are making billions on these vaccines developed with taxpayer money. And that the only sensible thing to do in this case would be to convert the patents into common property and stop this money-making scheme.</p>
<a id="S188"><h2>Vaccinated undesirables</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the U.S., vaccinated people are already being discriminated against in many states because people have been persuaded by Fake News about infectious vaccines. And that clearly shows the need to get a better handle on misinformation.</p>
<a id="S189"><h2>No Harmful Substances</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there have been enough studies of masks and test kits that have shown there are no toxins, contaminants or harmful substances. And that the safety structures here can be well relied upon.</p>
<a id="S190"><h2>mRNA also anti-cancer</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA technology is a boon to humanity that will help fight many more diseases in the near future. And that cancer is already in the works as the next use case.</p>
<a id="S191"><h2>One would have started in Africa</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that would be the mass vaccination a measure of population control, one would have started that in Africa instead of in the industrial nations. And that this already takes away the basis of this far-fetched thesis.</p>
<a id="S192"><h2>Adverse effects easy to report</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide vaccination adverse effects have been recorded in appropriate public registries for decades. And that these allow for very straightforward reporting and therefore allow for a good estimate of the true adverse event proportion.</p>
<a id="S193"><h2>Relying on others</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anti vaxxers are egoists who rely on the willingness of the vaccinated to take a tiny risk for the greater good. And that because they refuse to vaccinate, we all have to wait longer.</p>
<a id="S194"><h2>Politicians love power</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that overly restrictive, perverse or excessive measures that politicians enact much faster than they take them back are merely a sign of their obsession with power.</p>
<a id="S195"><h2>Distributed among hospitals</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis in countries with good health care systems like Germany has caused fewer supply bottlenecks than in others, due in part to the even distribution of patients among available hospitals.</p>
<a id="S196"><h2>No basic immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is still no basic immunity in the population against the novel virus and its many mutations. And that therefore the vaccination campaign must be carried through to the end.</p>
<a id="S197"><h2>Everything has side effects</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everything, even supposedly harmless foods and drugs, can have side effects with a certain probability. And that if you're brave enough for aspirin or chocolate, you can also get vaccinated against the virus.</p>
<a id="S198"><h2>Local outbreaks proof</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many local outbreaks of the virus at parties, businesses or homes, for example, that have been reported in the media are proof enough of its dangerousness. And that we should always be aware of this risk.</p>
<a id="S199"><h2>Thromboses always happen</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the risk of thrombosis exists in many contexts, such as flying, birth control pills, and even by the corona disease itself. And that so far thromboses occurring after vaccinations have been rarer than in these contexts and also could not be clearly attributed to the vaccination.</p>
<a id="S200"><h2>Died WITH not BY the vaccine</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a large number of people in the country die every day. And that if the entire population is vaccinated within a very short period of time, deaths after vaccination are statistically expectable.</p>
<a id="S201"><h2>Protects against severe courses</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination does not protect against contracting the virus, but it does protect against a severe course of the viral disease. And that this protection benefits oneself and also the community by helping to protect the healthcare system from overload.</p>
<a id="S202"><h2>Cases only in the unvaccinated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that severe courses of corona occur more and more frequently only in the unvaccinated due to the progressing vaccination campaign. And that therefore the unvaccinated put themselves and the health care system in unnecessary danger through their refusal.</p>
<a id="S203"><h2>Relaxing measures is an experiment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that relaxing all policy-imposed measures is an irresponsible experiment. And that measures on a certain scale to protect public health have now become indispensable.</p>
<a id="S204"><h2>Vaccinating children protect all</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccinating children help to protect many other vulnerable groups of people from Corona infection, even without being one of them. And that only with the solidary vaccination of the children we reach a vaccination rate that can lead us out of the pandemic.</p>
<a id="S205"><h2>Organ damage from Long Covid</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that permanent organ damage such as heart muscle inflammation and cardiac arrhythmias, and also lung damage and respiratory problems are frequent diagnoses of Long Covid patients. And that unfortunately there is no reporting system for these long-term consequences.</p>
<a id="S206"><h2>Disinformation Dozen</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that twelve people in particular have been identified among the Corona fake news outlets on the Internet. And that if one were to block the distribution channels of this "disinformation dozen", the crisis could be handled much better right away.</p>
<a id="S207"><h2>Every day a plane crash or 9/11</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Covid casualty figures are best placed in a disaster context like a plane crash to understand their magnitude. And that no one would want to maintain a situation like the current pandemic under these circumstances.</p>
<a id="S208"><h2>Sacrifice few to protect many more</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the principle of vaccination has always been to sacrifice a few to save many. And that this is also the case with the Corona vaccination, and no one claims that there are no side effects at all, but only a vanishingly small number.</p>
<a id="S209"><h2>Vaccination makes more economic sense</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the principle of vaccination is simply the more sensible solution from the point of view of the national economy in relation to going through a disease naturally en masse. And that the aspect of sick leave should be included in decisions.</p>
<a id="S210"><h2>Dull criticism of capitalism</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the criticism of the profits and the contractual practices of the large vaccine manufacturers is only a dull, inappropriate critique of capitalism.

<a id="S211"><h2>mRNA technology has long been mature</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the technology mRNA vaccination is a mature solution after long years of research and only the studies could not be continued because previous corona virus pandemics like SARS have ended on their own.</p>
<a id="S212"><h2>Locking out non-vaccinated people to protect them</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the regulations introduced in many countries to exclude non-vaccinated people from social life, cultural events and shops also serve their own protection. And that they can regain access at any time through vaccination.</p>
<a id="S213"><h2>No right to infect others</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people do not have to vaccinate themselves, but that by not vaccinating they practically take over the right to infect others. And that they do not have this right and therefore the state must ensure the physical integrity of others through its measures.</p>
<a id="S214"><h2>Doctors are trained</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the dissenters to Corona typically do not have the necessary medical training to be able to assess the correctness of the Corona measures supported by the vast majority of doctors. And that they should therefore be cautious about their views.</p>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the dissenters to Corona typically do not have the requisite experience as medical practitioners to be able to assess the correctness of the Corona measures carried out by the vast majority of doctors.

<a id="S216"><h2>Side effects are mild</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that although there is a lot of talk about side effects of vaccination, these are usually mild side effects such as brief pain in the arm or headaches. And that these effects can also be observed with other vaccinations.</p>
<a id="S217"><h2>Safety standards complied with</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that while the vaccines were developed in an accelerated process to get results faster, all safety standards were met in the process. And that one can therefore have confidence in them.</p>
<a id="S218"><h2>Sufficiently less contagious</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that re-vaccinated people therefore no longer need to be tested, that they are sufficiently less infectious compared to non-vaccinated people. And that about the renunciation of testing yes must also give an incentive to vaccinate.</p>
<a id="S219"><h2>What pressure?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the alleged social pressure to vaccinate is in fact no pressure, but merely a sensible policy in the sense of epidemiology. And that whoever refuses this cannot speak of repression.</p>
<a id="S220"><h2>Vaccinations greatest achievement</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is common knowledge that vaccinations are one of the greatest medical achievements in human history. And that it is incomprehensible that so many people have turned away from this concept.</p>
<a id="S221"><h2>No right to eat in a restaurant</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the restrictions on non-vaccinated people are merely political measures to contain a pandemic. And that you cannot invoke your fundamental rights when you are excluded from restaurants and shops.</p>
<a id="S222"><h2>Do not want to contribute</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that most non-vaccinated stay cold, they do not want to contribute to a finally back to normal life for all. And that this is a sign of how stupid and uneducated our society has become!</p>
<a id="S223"><h2>Fear of control = more control</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the fear of state control in the Corona context ultimately creates the precondition for the need for more state control. And that this vicious circle can only be broken by obedience.</p>
<a id="S224"><h2>Seeing DNA change as an opportunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> ...that if you think an mRNA vaccine will change your DNA, think of it as an opportunity...</p>
<a id="S225"><h2>100% vaccination rate = 100% vaccinated sick people</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the reference to vaccinated people who are also infected with the virus and treated in hospital makes little sense if large parts of the population are already vaccinated. And that with a 100% vaccination rate, all sick people are vaccinated.</p>
<a id="S226"><h2>Be calm, it'll soon be over</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the pandemic will be over at some point and that we should just be more relaxed until then. And that with the great goal of ending the pandemic in mind, the measures can be endured in a much more relaxed manner.</p>
<a id="S227"><h2>Vaccines no long-term effects</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the current Corona vaccines cannot have any negative long-term effects, if only because their principle of operation renders them ineffective in a short time. And that concerns in this regard are unfounded.</p>
<a id="S228"><h2>Pharma companies communicates poorly</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, pharma industry is already doing some "crooked" things and communicating poorly and that is reason for denial. But that this denial is inappropriate in this case and keeps us all stuck in the pandemic.</p>
<a id="S229"><h2>We only have to vaccinate everyone</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if everyone had been vaccinated, there would be far fewer infections and the health system would be far from overburdened. And that with a maximum vaccination rate we would have overcome the pandemic long ago.</p>
<a id="S230"><h2>Non-vaccinated are threat</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people are a threat to society within a pandemic, as their refusal to do so makes it impossible to overcome the crisis together. And that society therefore has a right to defend itself against them, just as it must defend itself against terrorism.</p>
<a id="S231"><h2>Not a doctor / scientist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that to Corona dissenters are just not doctors or scientists and therefore can not overlook the complex situation. And that more trust in the knowledge and experience of the experts would be more than appropriate.</p>
<a id="S232"><h2>Don't know any</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they do not have any serious side effects in their family and circle of acquaintances and that the problem can therefore not be so relevant. And that at the same time, in any case, but they know many Corona victims.</p>
<a id="S233"><h2>Do not allow the state to be blackmailed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state must not allow itself to be blackmailed by the dissenters to Corona and their demonstrations and other protest actions. And that the state in the pandemic has above all to ensure the enforcement of the interests of the majority.</p>
<a id="S234"><h2>Exclusion is important</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the exclusion of non-vaccinated people from social life has an important educational function. And that in this way they can be made aware that they themselves are contributing to an unnecessary prolongation of the exceptional situation and should do something about it through their vaccination.</p>
<a id="S235"><h2>Side effects / vaccination deaths coincidence</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many people die every day and that this fact alone results in a probability of dying after a vaccination. And that we observe as supposed side effects and vaccination deaths in connection with the high number of vaccinations mainly this effect.</p>
<a id="S236"><h2>Relaxations only with a high vaccination rate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the call for relaxations must not be followed, since a high vaccination rate is a prerequisite for the withdrawal of measures. And that this connection is clearly proven by field studies in other countries.</p>
<a id="S237"><h2>Just personal anecdotes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that when people report side effects in themselves or in their environment, these are only personal anecdotes that cannot be generalized. And that these have no statistical relevance.</p>
<a id="S238"><h2>Nothing happens to billions</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if you look at the reported vaccine side effects, nothing has happened with billions of vaccinations.</p>
<a id="S239"><h2>Non-vaccinated people get sicker</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people have been shown to contract corona most quickly and intensely, and are more likely to end up in intensive care.</p>
<a id="S240"><h2>Delegitimization of the state by critics</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state must resist all attempts to be delegitimized by Corona critics. And that this danger exists especially when the executive fails to act decisively when laws and regulations are violated.</p>
<a id="S241"><h2>Not spreading nonsense is not one-sided</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that media that refrain from spreading unsubstantiated information or even total nonsense do not automatically report in a one-sided manner. And that they are bound by certain quality standards that don't apply to sources like Telegram.</p>
<a id="S242"><h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Dunning-Kruger effect is at work in many too Corona dissenters, i.e. they are incompetent people who overestimate their own knowledge and ability. And that this is based on the inability to judge themselves objectively by means of metacognition.</p>
<a id="S243"><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy places</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the fact that non-vaccinated people fall ill more often and more severely during the pandemic has the effect of an increasing the number of hospital beds occupied by them. And that these beds are no longer available for other patients.</p>
<a id="S244"><h2>State of the art</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the image presented to the public on the crisis and its background is created by recourse to experts and represents the state of science. And that alternative views are mostly unscientific or scientific sideshows.</p>
<a id="S245"><h2>You do not have the absolute truth</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many dissenters to Corona often appear so self-confident and convinced, as if they had the absolute truth. And that one could not take them seriously already because of this missing self-reflection and -criticism.</p>
<a id="S246"><h2>Self-proclaimed critics/journalists</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many pretentious and incompetent people pose as critics and journalists in the Corona context without having the necessary skills. And that these are rightly written down or ignored by the major media.</p>
<a id="S247"><h2>State cares, makes vaccinations free</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the state cares about its citizens in the pandemic by providing vaccinations free of charge to all. And that it is ungrateful and selfish to refuse this offer for the benefit of all.</p>
<a id="S248"><h2>Defiance phase like with children</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the negative attitude of vaccination opponents often reminds without any evidence strongly of the defiant phase known from childhood, which one should actually have overcome in adulthood.</p>
<a id="S249"><h2>Do not reward the unsolid</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, unsound behaviour must not be further rewarded, otherwise the pillars of our society are in danger.</p>
<a id="S250"><h2>Higher contributions for vaccination refusers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination refusers are irresponsible with their bodies, comparable to couch potatoes or bungee jumpers. And that they are a burden on the solidarity community and should therefore be charged higher contributions.</p>
<a id="S251"><h2>The government would never do that</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they cannot imagine their own government being ruthless enough for such a far-reaching deception of its own people. And that the critics' assumptions in this direction are unrealistically far-reaching.</p>
<a id="S252"><h2>WITH but not ON: double standards</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that just as one can argue that many died not ON but WITH the virus, one can argue analogously that many died not ON but WITH the vaccination. And that whoever doesn't want to see that, has double standards.</p>
<a id="S253"><h2>Pandemic of the unvaccinated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people are largely responsible for the continuation of the pandemic, as they fall ill more frequently and more severely and thus place excessive demands on medical care structures. And that it is therefore only fair to exclude them from social life through selected measures.</p>
<a id="S254"><h2>Breakthroughs because not 100% protection</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination breakthroughs can be explained, because the vaccination does not protect 100%. And that even insbeonsdere pre-existing conditions and other factors can reduce their effectiveness.</p>
<a id="S255"><h2>Only non-vaccinated people in intensive care units</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, according to official data from hospitals, almost only non-vaccinated people are treated in intensive care units. And that this information is nevertheless a clear indication that the pandemic goes on and on, mainly due to vaccination refusers.</p>
<a id="S256"><h2>The only thing missing is the next booster</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the reason for the increase in covid cases even among vaccinated people is that their vaccination was already too far back to be sufficiently effective. And that therefore they have only lacked the booster to continue to escape the disease.</p>
<a id="S257"><h2>Zoo animals also already vaccinated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the meantime even zoo animals have been vaccinated against Corona. And that as a critic one does not want to be inferior to them after all.
</p>
<a id="S258"><h2>Heart problems only imagined</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many people, often due to misinformation on the net, misinterpret signals of their own body and imagine, for example, to have heart problems or the like after vaccination. And that you can also put people unnecessarily in fear of a harmless and safe intervention.</p>
<a id="S259"><h2>In the past also "suddenly and unexpectedly"</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that also in former times people died suddenly and unexpectedly and now one only blames the vaccination for it, because it just fits to the own point of view.</p>
<a id="S260"><h2>Critics just look for matching papers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Corona-critics are just looking for the appropriate scientific papers for their views on the net, without knowing the scientifically correct procedure, let alone being able to read the papers properly.</p>
<a id="S261"><h2>Own freedom stops with the others</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the deliberately unvaccinated are a health hazard to everyone else around them. And that in their insistence on their freedoms they overlook the fact that these freedoms end where the rights of others begin.</p>
<a id="S262"><h2>Vaccinated courage fills hospitals</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that before vaccination, many people refrained from hospital visits for fear of infection. And that now, with renewed courage, hospitals are filling up with many non-Corona cases.</p>
<a id="S263"><h2>All side effects also with Covid</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all the potentially feared side effects of vaccination, including thrombosis, myocarditis, etc., are much more common with Covid infection and have a much more difficult course. And that therefore everything that is scary about vaccination should be much more scary about covid infection.</p>
<a id="S264"><h2>Vaccinated are still not dead</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the thesis that vaccinated people will die in a few months turns out to be misinformation, because we vaccinated people are still not dead. And that something must have gone wrong with this prognosis.</p>
<a id="S265"><h2>Functioning society only with commitment</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that you can't have everything without giving something in return. And that in a functioning society egoism has no place and that egoists must also feel this.</p>
<a id="S266"><h2>Triage for non-vaccinated persons</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they advocate triage for non-vaccinated people, because those who don't get vaccinated now act at their own risk and shouldn't take away anyone else's ICU space.</p>
<a id="S267"><h2>Egoism accusation freedom of speech</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the accusation of egoism against the deliberately non-vaccinated also falls under the freedom of opinion which they so vehemently propagate. And that their indignation about it therefore amounts to a double standard.</p>
<a id="S268"><h2>Non-vaccinated people the test does not help</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if a non-vaccinated person tests negative before going to a restaurant or theater, that doesn't protect him from catching the virus from a vaccinated person there. And the latter then possibly blocking the intensive care bed a few days later, which an accident victim urgently needs.</p>
<a id="S269"><h2>DDR compulsory vaccination works well</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that compulsory vaccination could be a possible, restrictive way to overcome the pandemic if all other incentives for voluntary vaccination fail. And that good experiences with compulsory vaccination have already been made in the GDR.</p>
<a id="S270"><h2>Who harms the majority =&gt; consequences</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that whoever makes a decision as an adult that potentially harms the majority society must also bear the consequences of that decision. And that we can no longer afford to be considerate of the inconsiderate and selfish if we want to defeat the pandemic.</p>
<a id="S271"><h2>Vaccination myths are a problem for everyone</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many myths and conspiracy narratives circulating on the net are preventing many people from doing their part to overcome the pandemic. And that it must therefore be seen as a problem for all of us to combat.</p>
<a id="S272"><h2>If smallpox still had</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all the misinformation on the Internet is preventing us from defeating the virus. And that, fortunately, the Internet has not been around that long, otherwise mankind would probably never have succeeded in eradicating polio and smallpox.</p>
<a id="S273"><h2>Side effects are immune reaction</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the s are not from the vaccination, but from the immune response it triggers. And that the same immune reaction would have occurred in the case of an infection.</p>
<a id="S274"><h2>Common good trumps self-determination</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are situations in which the common good outweighs self-determination and individual freedoms. And that the current pandemic and global vaccination campaign to overcome it is just such a case.</p>
<a id="S275"><h2>Dangerous horse dewormer</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the ivermectin advertised by vaccination opponents is an unproven and therefore dangerous drug from veterinary medicine used to deworm horses. And that one should urgently refrain from treating with it.</p>
<a id="S276"><h2>Compensation fund for vaccination damage</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that for the rare vaccination damages, which are and have been caused by mass vaccinations, appropriate compensation funds have long been established. And that there is therefore no insurance problem.</p>
<a id="S277"><h2>Breakthroughs in patients with severe pre-conditions</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the protection provided by vaccination is very high, but that serious illnesses can still occur if patients have risk factors such as previous illnesses, obesity or a weak or suppressed immune system. And that vaccination cannot perform miracles.</p>
<a id="S278"><h2>Long experience with vaccinations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mankind has hundreds of years of experience and success with the principle of vaccination behind it. And that we are benefiting from this experience in dealing with the current pandemic.</p>
<a id="S279"><h2>mRNA vaccination is known and safe</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA vaccines have been researched for many decades and therefore s and problems are well known. And that they can therefore be considered safe.</p>
<a id="S280"><h2>Non-vaccinated people are pandemic drivers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the remaining non-vaccinated pose a risk of infection to everyone else due to their higher susceptibility to the virus. And that they must therefore be kept away from the public as further drivers of the pandemic.</p>
<a id="S281"><h2>Intensive care beds also need staff</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the reference to free intensive care beds does not allow any statement about the real capacities, since personnel is always required to operate them. And that it is therefore not meaningful to consider the number of beds alone.</p>
<a id="S282"><h2>Balancing of civil rights</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that those who insist on their fundamental rights in times of pandemic overlook the right to health of their fellow human beings. And that this right weighs just as much as the rights they demand, and that politicians must therefore weigh them up.</p>
<a id="S283"><h2>Powerlessness against non-vaccinated people</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the non-vaccinated are imprisoning the rest of society by their refusal and therefore you are angry and feel powerless.</p>
<a id="S284"><h2>Late effects not to be expected</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that long experience with vaccinations show that the feared s that only appear a long time after vaccination are not to be expected. And that vaccinations usually unfold their effect within a manageable period of time.</p>
<a id="S285"><h2>My vaccination prevented worse</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they have had Covid after the vaccination, but that it would have been much worse if they had not been vaccinated. And that they are glad to have been vaccinated.</p>
<a id="S286"><h2>Asymptomatic transmission also with herpes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the effect of assymptomatic transmission is not at all absurd, but also occurs in other diseases such as herpes.</p>
<a id="S287"><h2>Individual responsibility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that one feels a personal responsibility for immunocompromised or -suppressed colleagues and relatives in one's own environment and therefore adheres to the prescribed measures and not because of one's own risk.</p>
<a id="S288"><h2>False adverse event reports</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination opponents flood the reporting system for adverse events with false reports, just as they have been shown to influence media surveys. And that therefore no conclusions can be drawn from the high reporting figures.</p>
<a id="S289"><h2>Denmark's about-face?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> what about Denmark's about-face after their Freedom Day? And that it's probably not as easy to return to normality as the critics would like.</p>
<a id="S290"><h2>How to drive drunk</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that refusal to vaccinate without good reason is equivalent to driving drunk, because you also endanger not only themselves but also others. Indeed, sober people also build accidents, but here the probability is lower.</p>
<a id="S291"><h2>Breakthroughs only in risk groups</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination breakthroughs are not a general phenomenon but occur mainly in risk groups with pre-existing conditions. And that this effect is also understandable, because here the vaccination can do less than in healthy people.</p>
<a id="S292"><h2>Non-vaccinated people take society hostage</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that by insisting on their freedom and self-determination over their bodies, the non-vaccinated are practically taking the sensible rest of society hostage. For through their attitude a return to normality is not possible.</p>
<a id="S293"><h2>No treatment for non-vaccinated persons</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people, as they deliberately take the greater risk of falling ill and possibly burdening the health system in the process, would have to forego treatment or cope with being the very last to be treated in an overload situation.</p>
<a id="S294"><h2>Non-vaccinated occupy beds</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people occupy hospital beds unnecessarily and thus use up the reserves early. And that, as a result, the responsible, vaccinated rest of the population has to endure the corresponding measures that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>
<a id="S295"><h2>Financial participation of non-vaccinated persons</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is time to think about financial participation in medical costs for non-vaccinated people. And that otherwise at the expense of the whole society people are treated who consciously renounce a risk minimization.</p>
<a id="S296"><h2>Lax controls irresponsible</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the catering and club sector, compliance with the rules is often not properly controlled and that this can lead to outbreaks again and again. And that therefore more control of the controllers with sensitive penalties must take place.</p>
<a id="S297"><h2>Side effects rate normal</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if you put the s of the Corona vaccine in relation to the quantities vaccinated - billions of people - their proportion is vanishingly small. And that the risks are comparable to those of classical vaccines.</p>
<a id="S298"><h2>Compensation solution is long since in place</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, as with all other recommended vaccines, there is already a state compensation scheme in place. And that one is therefore already covered against the risk of becoming a victim of the very rare s.</p>
<a id="S299"><h2>Liability exemption makes vaccination possible</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that exempting vaccine manufacturers from liability is what makes the successful fight against pandemics possible in the first place. And that if politicians had insisted on manufacturer liability for damages, we would not have vaccines at all now.</p>
<a id="S300"><h2>Virus contact inevitable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the next three years it's very likely that everyone will come into contact with the virus. And that you will then either be dead or recovered, with the vaccination rather the latter.</p>
<a id="S301"><h2>Duties convince the unwilling</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that other areas of life with corresponding risks show that you can only convince the unwilling with obligations. And that good examples of this are the seat belt and helmet obligations in road traffic.</p>
<a id="S302"><h2>Spain and Portugal successful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the numbers are lower or falling in countries like Spain and Portugal with high vaccination rates. And that their vaccination programmes have successfully contained the pandemic and should therefore be used as a model for other countries.</p>
<a id="S303"><h2>Test exemption required as motivation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the test exemption for vaccinated people is not completely conclusive, as they can still be infectious. But that this is a matter of consideration, since this exemption is absolutely necessary as a motivation and incentive for vaccination.</p>
<a id="S304"><h2>Side effects rarer than lightning strike</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the risk of fatal side effects from vaccination is less than being struck by lightning. And that fears of these are irrational and do not do justice to the real probabilities.</p>
<a id="S305"><h2>After a few days through the body</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the active substances of the vaccination are already out of the body a few days after the injection. And that they do not act further than 10cm away from the injection site in the body.</p>
<a id="S306"><h2>Cannot penetrate cell nucleus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the administered genetic information in the mRNA or vector vaccines does not penetrate into cell nuclei. And that therefore there is also no possibility that one's own genetic information could be changed by the vaccination.</p>
<a id="S307"><h2>Adverse event reports can be duplicates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the portals for recording adverse events are automated and that there is no verification of the reports. And that the data there is not reliable, because everyone can report something there as often as they want.</p>
<a id="S308"><h2>So far only lucky with mutations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as humanity have so far only been lucky during the pandemic that no really dangerous mutations have arisen. And things can get much worse if the virus becomes significantly more deadly or significantly more contagious than before.</p>
<a id="S309"><h2>Covid deaths not registered</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are many covid victims who died in private, who were not hospitalized and for whom no tests were performed. And that this dark figure strongly distorts the statistics into the positive.</p>
<a id="S310"><h2>Omicron variant</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the mutation B.1.1.529 or Omikron combines the dangerousness of several other mutations. And that the danger of this variant for the public health system comes in particular from its high infection rate.</p>
<a id="S311"><h2>Politics has failed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we would have overcome the pandemic in our own country long ago if politics had not failed. And that this failure is primarily due to a lack of laws and regulations, or laws and regulations that are too lax, and insufficient state intervention against critics and objectors.</p>
<a id="S312"><h2>Refused tests on Covid deaths</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that families of the deceased often enforce that no test be done or that Covid not be on the cause of death on the death certificate to save themselves the hassle and restrictions of a Covid burial. And that this distorts the statistics.</p>
<a id="S313"><h2>Covid victim despite negative test</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that patients who test negative again weeks after contracting the disease can still die from the damage it caused. And that it therefore makes sense to always assume Covid as the cause of death if there was a positive test within a certain period of time before death.</p>
<a id="S314"><h2>Vaccination boosts male fertility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Covid vaccination improves the sperm quality of the male. And that it has no negative but even a positive effect on male fertility.</p>
<a id="S315"><h2>Corona infection worsens fertility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a passed infection with the coronavirus can harm the sexual health of the man. And that this is another reason why vaccination is a sensible protective measure.</p>
<a id="S316"><h2>Statistics of one</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people usually base their assessment of risks on their own experience. And that one's own not getting sick or the lack of victims in one's own environment can give one a false sense of security.</p>
<a id="S317"><h2>Telegram Fates Are Fake</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many fates of side effect victims communicated via alternative media channels like Telegram are typically fake. And that it is better to rely on official, verified sources to assess the real situation.</p>
<a id="S318"><h2>Current excess mortality is "post-harvest"</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the significant excess mortality observed in many cases since the start of the vaccination campaigns has nothing to do with vaccination, but that the victims are rather the natural "after-harvest" of the closed period created by the previous lockdowns.</p>
<a id="S319"><h2>No correlation for side effects</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the causal relationship to vaccination cannot be established for most side effects. And that the occurrence of diseases and also deaths in a temporal context due to the immense number of vaccinations can also be explained by statistical coincidence.</p>
<a id="S320"><h2>Young people not invulnerable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that currently many young people believe themselves invulnerable to the virus and therefore even provoke the infection. And that this is a fallacy that many will pay for with their health or even their lives.</p>
<a id="S321"><h2>Non-vaccinated people are a risk for all</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that non-vaccinated people play with the risk of all, because even a negative test does not protect them from catching the virus. And that they might then block an intensive care bed that an accident victim urgently needs.</p>
<a id="S322"><h2>Basic trust in processes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is paradoxical that people in crisis abandon their trust in some tried and tested mechanisms, but cling to them in other areas. And that the lack of common ground makes them difficult if not impossible to reach.</p>
<a id="S323"><h2>The world is as it seems</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it is safe to assume that the world out there is as it appears and conspiracies are much more difficult than many think. After all, different interests are hard to reconcile and collusion hard to keep secret.</p>
<a id="S324"><h2>Expertise has its meaning</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that not everyone can be knowledgeable in all areas and that it therefore makes sense in the rules to rely on experts instead of overestimating oneself. And that this division of tasks is what makes our complex world controllable in the first place.</p>
<a id="S325"><h2>Dangerous to the state</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a considerable part of the critics of the Corona policy no longer believe in the political structures and mechanisms of democracy and act openly hostile to the state. And that therefore the state and protection of the bourgeois majority must act even more rigorously against these people.</p>
<a id="S326"><h2>Aspiration not necessary</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that aspiration prior to injection of the vaccines is not necessary according to official recommendations because the blood vessels at the body sites recommended for injection and within reach of the needle are too small for accidental intravascular administration. And that there are no reports of injury to patients due to failure to aspirate.</p>
<a id="S327"><h2>Pandemics are not a novelty</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there have always been pandemics in the history of mankind, e.g. the Spanish flu, so why not in our time as well? Currently, the probability of a pandemic is possibly even higher, since we as humanity are becoming more and more and this is so unsustainable when it comes to the symbiosis with and the preservation of our environment.</p>
<a id="S328"><h2>Recurring vaccinations have been around for long</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the devaluation of the Corona Booster vaccinations as a vaccination subscription or trap falsely suggests that they contain a novel element, when there have long been vaccinations that are regularly administered to be effective, such as the flu or tick vaccination.</p>
<a id="S329"><h2>Of course the pandemic is exploited</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis situation that the pandemic represents worldwide is of course being exploited by many interest groups. But that this does not necessarily mean that they have also brought about the crisis in the form of an unrealistic, comprehensive conspiracy in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<a id="S330"><h2>Moral obligation to vaccinate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the current crisis, which we can only overcome with joint efforts and joint sacrifices, one can at least speak of a moral duty to vaccinate. And that whoever opposes this must at least expect to be confronted with this moral violation by his fellow human beings.</p>
<a id="S331"><h2>Darwin Award for non-vaccinated people</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the sarcastic negative award for people who harm or kill themselves through their own fault and show a special degree of stupidity should also be given to the group of non-vaccinated people.</p>
<a id="S332"><h2>Omicron not a wave but a wall</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that with the new variant Omikron, due to its high infection rate, one must no longer speak of just an epidemic wave but of a wall. And that this expected excess of infected people, even with less severe diseases, has the potential to overburden the health system.</p>
<a id="S333"><h2>Politics again and again the same mistakes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that a nationwide lockdown is not always appropriate, and that tough regional restrictions can sometimes be sufficient. But where there is lockdown on it, there must also be lockdown in it, because we really have had enough half-heartedness in politics.</p>
<a id="S334"><h2>Kennedy was always a nutcase</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Robert F. Kennedy, one of the central figures for the dissenters, has been an irrational anti-vaxxer and self-proclaimed child protector since before the crisis. And that there is therefore no reason to trust him on any issues now.</p>
<a id="S335"><h2>Athletes also collapsed earlier</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that athletes have always been at risk due to the heavy physical strain. And that without reliable comparative figures from the past, it is not possible to assess the many collapses.</p>
<a id="S336"><h2>Vaccination victims only suspected cases</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all cases reported in the adverse events databases are only suspected cases. And since it can hardly be established with certainty that there is a causal connection to vaccination, these figures do not allow any statements to be made about the proportion of vaccine injuries.</p>
<a id="S337"><h2>Vaccine doses ordered for the third world</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many vaccines pre-ordered en masse by the EU and other major nations are likely to be made available to poorer countries in the future. And that no alleged plans for a longer duration of the pandemic can be derived from these orders.</p>
<a id="S338"><h2>Clearly a mass psychosis</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the opposition and the arguments of the Corona critics can meanwhile be seen as a mass psychosis, since delusions of totalitarian world domination and vaccination conspiracies prevail here. And that this psychosis is still fueled by many beneficiaries.</p>
<a id="S339"><h2>Now everything's a vaccine side effect</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the critics of the vaccination now seem to interpret every health change in their environment as a vaccination side effect. And in doing so, they ignore the fact that there are coincidences and also that people age and in the course of this also decline in health.</p>
<a id="S340"><h2>Compulsory vaccination helps save face</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many critics of vaccination now have no way of backing away from their position and saving face. And that a vaccination obligation helps exactly these people to get out of the blockade attitude by the state default.</p>
<a id="S341"><h2>Vaccine remains in your arm</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the vaccine cannot be responsible for the many alleged side effects, since it remains in the arm of the vaccinated person. And that the few cases are more likely to be a coincidence than real side effects.</p>
<a id="S342"><h2>Refreshers useful until the end of the pandemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that every individual can contribute to a quick end of the pandemic by following the official recommendations for booster vaccinations. And that, since the effect is limited, these boosters are logically useful until the end of the pandemic.</p>
<a id="S343"><h2>Relatively few vaccination breakthroughs</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the critics' highlighting of vaccine breakthroughs only serves to call into question the effectiveness of vaccination. And that in reality very few suffer such a breakthrough in relation to the total number of vaccinated people.</p>
<a id="S344"><h2>Rapid approval to contain the pandemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the much-criticised fast-track procedure for testing and approving vaccines was necessary precisely because a global pandemic had to be contained. And that only this speed saved the world from a much worse course of the crisis.</p>
<a id="S345"><h2>Omicron could end pandemic</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the now prevailing omicron variant with its much milder course could mean an end to the pandemic, as it resembles influenza in its dangerousness. And that now possibly the policy could be directed towards an acceptance of the risk.</p>
<a id="S346"><h2>Anti-Vaxers in the 19th century</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the refusal to vaccinate already existed with smallpox vaccination in 19th century Europe. And that then as now, people were led astray by irrational fears and unscientific claims.</p>
<a id="S347"><h2>Infection is dirty immunization</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that contracting the virus directly without prior vaccination protection is a kind of risky, dirty immunization. And that while you can do it, vaccination is a much safer and cleaner way to immunize yourself.</p>
<a id="S348"><h2>Vaccination signals acceptance of the measures</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the fact that the vast majority of people worldwide are choosing to be vaccinated is a clear signal of approval of government protective measures and regulations. And that the critics only mobilize a tiny part of the population.</p>
<a id="S349"><h2>No real discrimination</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the discrimination by social exclusion claimed by the vaccination critics is in fact not discrimination at all, since the vaccination status is not an unchangeable characteristic like homosexuality and skin color.</p>
<a id="S350"><h2>I trust the science</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the vast majority of scientists share a uniform view of the danger of corona and the benefits of vaccinations. And that they, as representatives of science, are trusted more than the isolated critics.</p>
