<h1>The<i> Sheeple</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="S1"><h2>What about Bergamo?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in Bergamo, Italy were completely overloaded in March, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S2"><h2>What about New York?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in New York were completely overburdened in April, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S3"><h2>Flatten the Curve!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if infection rates rise, we need these measures to flatten the curve again. And that otherwise our health system will inevitably be overloaded to the detriment of all!</p>
<a id="S4"><h2>Prevent triage</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if the health care system is overloaded, the staff will eventually be forced to prefer patients to others in triage because they can no longer treat all of them. And that this must be prevented under all circumstances!</p>
<a id="S5"><h2>Coffins stacking</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everywhere where the virus has really broken out, the coffins have piled up near the hospitals. And that the military had to help with the transport!</p>
<a id="S6"><h2>Exponen&shy;tial!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, as soon as the curve of the infected begins to rise exponentially, one must assume a continuation in exponential form. And that therefore drastic measures for the containment are justified!</p>
<a id="S7"><h2>It's only a mask</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing a mask according to the guidelines would be a negligible sacrifice to protect everyone. And that they cannot understand the criticism of this at all.</p>
<a id="S8"><h2>Aerosols</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is transmitted via aerosols e.g. by breathing, speaking and singing, even if the person concerned does not have any symptoms. And that wearing masks helps to prevent these aerosols from spreading.</p>
<a id="S9"><h2>Even the young die</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that young people are also affected to a relevant extent by severe courses or even death from the virus. And that we cannot therefore rely on not belonging to the risk group.</p>
<a id="S10"><h2>Nature strikes back</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as human beings are to blame for the crisis, because we have thoughtlessly destroyed nature and thus our own habitat in the past. And that nature now just strikes back.</p>
<a id="S11"><h2>Corona Parties</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that when people celebrate, dance and relax together, it contributes to a dangerous spread of the virus. And that we therefore have to avoid these things in the future.</p>
<a id="S12"><h2>Our planet recovers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns are good for the planet. That air and water pollution will decrease when tourism, cruises and aviation are no longer available. And that it would therefore be nice if this could simply continue to be handled in the same way.</p>
<a id="S13"><h2>Long-term con&shy;sequences</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after such a short time, nothing can be said about the long-term consequences of the new viral disease. And that it is therefore justified that people continue to be as careful as possible and follow the decreed measures.</p>
<a id="S14"><h2>We still know so little</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because one knows too little about the virus and its dangerousness after such a short time, it is justified to demand some privations from the people first. And that only when one has sufficiently examined the virus and found it to be of little risk, one can start life up again.</p>
<a id="S15"><h2>Politi&shy;cians play it safe</h2></a>

<a id="S17"><h2>Can think for myself</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they do not need to read the alternative media from which critical minds draw their information and assessments. They can think for themselves and do not need these voices.</p>
<a id="S18"><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that an overly critical attitude and, in particular, evidence that motives other than our health may be at play, all of which are conspiracy theories and should not be further investi&shy;gated.</p>
<a id="S19"><h2>Sweden death rate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that due to the higher death rate the "Swedish way", i.e. the renuncia&shy;tion of lockdowns and emergency decrees, would not be an option for the rest of the world. And that those who demand it simply want to accept more victims.</p>
<a id="S20"><h2>Trump position</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, when Donald Trump, as the clown of an U.S. president, expresses critical and erroneous views on the virus or the measures, that one should not adopt any of these positions. And that having the same views as Trump always puts you on the wrong side!</p>
<a id="S21"><h2>Immunity does not last</h2></a>
<p>They say <i> in all seriousness</i> that antibodies to the Corona virus have not been detected for COVID patients shortly after their illness! And that one must therefore assume that herd immunity will not occur naturally.</p>
<a id="S22"><h2>Not a virologist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that virolo&shy;gists are the ones who can best assess all, including social, epi&shy;demio&shy;logical and medical aspects of the current virus crisis and the measures decreed. And that it is therefore best to listen to them instead of any others.</p>
<a id="S23"><h2>Protect others</h2></a>

<a id="S24"><h2>Listen to experts</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experts currently heard almost everywhere in the world who advocate lock&shy;downs and emergency ordinances are the only experts to listen to. And that other views would not matter.</p>

<a id="S26"><h2>Real Risk group</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because they or their friends or relatives belong to the risk group being concerned is justified. And that it is therefore under&shy;stand&shy;able not to be open to arguments against the measures.</p>
<a id="S27"><h2>Puts everyone in danger</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who oppose the currently suspended democratic procedures, lockdowns and emer&shy;gency decrees, e.g. through demons&shy;trations, are the ones who endanger all others. And that this right should best be taken away from them as well.</p>

<a id="S29"><h2>Children very contagious</h2></a>

<a id="S35"><h2>John Snow Memo&shy;randum</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, accor&shy;ding to the John Snow Memo&shy;randum, the morta&shy;lity rate (IFR) from COVID is much higher than that of an influenza, that there are also long-lasting COVID symp&shy;toms and that it's unclear how long immunity lasts. And that there&shy;fore the measures are appro&shy;priate and reason&shy;able.</p>
<a id="S36"><h2>Numbers low THANKS to Lockdown</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that infection rates have dropped again because the lockdown was so successful. And that it is an effective tool for containment not to be criticised.</p>
<a id="S37"><h2>What would you do?</h2></a>
<p>They<i> ask in all seriousness</i>, what you would do if you were in the position of the responsible politicians. Confron&shy;ted both with defense&shy;less victims in nursing homes and intensive care units, and with irre&shy;sponsible party-goers?</p>
<a id="S38"><h2>What freedoms?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they would not understand what freedoms the critics miss so much! And that they can be glad to be allowed to demons&shy;trate, although they don't even adhere to imposed conditions!</p>
<a id="S39"><h2>What basic rights?</h2></a>

<a id="S43"><h2>Not compar&shy;able</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that you can not and may not statistically compare the current crisis with flu situations of the past, because this time the majority has behaved very cautiously! And that this caution has certainly pushed the numbers massively down.</p>
<a id="S44"><h2>Popula&shy;tion density</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experien&shy;ces like in Sweden do not help us, because it is hardly inhabited land. And that the rest of Europe is not!</p>
<a id="S45"><h2>Question of per&shy;spective</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that someone who has dealt directly with suffering and death in the context of a virus inevitably has a completely different perspec&shy;tive than someone who has only dealt with numbers and curves. And that it is therefore better to show more humility!</p>

<a id="S51"><h2>Signal of solidarity</h2></a>

<a id="S52"><h2>Isolation unethical</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that isolating people of risk groups and not letting them participate in life is not an option. And that such a demand would be unethical!</p>
<a id="S53"><h2>Pregnant women at risk</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that pregnant women have a weaker immune system and therefore also are a risk group. And that we should therefore stick to the measures also for the best possible protection of pregnant women!</p>

<a id="S75"><h2>No False Positives</h2></a>

<a id="S80"><h2>More dange&shy;rous than flu</h2></a>

<a id="S87"><h2>Unre&shy;corded Cases</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many people fall ill with Corona and also suffer long time damage without it even being recorded in any statistics. And that therefore looking at the data alone does not allow for a valid evaluation of the crisis!</p>
<a id="S88"><h2>Lockdowns work</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns work. And that, for example, the radical lockdown in Ireland in October, including a movement radius of 5 km, was very effective. And that we would only have to follow this pattern for a few weeks to finally overcome the virus.</p>
<a id="S89"><h2>Herd Immunity no option</h2></a>

<a id="S101"><h2>Vaccination highly effective</h2></a>

<a id="S102"><h2>Asymptomatic transmission</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there are sufficient cases where we know of infection with the virus without there being symptoms of illness: and that this just makes it reasonable for us all to wear masks until we can protect ourselves with vaccine or medication.</p>
<a id="S103"><h2>Politicians simply incompetent</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many of the measures pursued worldwide to contain the virus are unsuitable is not intentional but simply due to incompetence of the politicians. And that this has always been the case in other areas as well.</p>
<a id="S104"><h2>Politician groupthink</h2></a>

<a id="S106"><h2>Number of Fates</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they can deduce the threatening nature of the new virus solely from the fact that they observe many more fates of illness and death in their own environment than in earlier years. And that this is probably a good indicator.</p>  
<a id="S107"><h2>Doctors don't cheat</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they consider it inconceivable that doctors and nursing staff falsify death certificates en masse because of financial incentives. And that one must be able to rely on the medical ethos here!</p>
<a id="S108"><h2>Immunity only with vaccine</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that with the dangerousness of the virus our own immune system is not sufficient for us humans. And that therefore vaccination is unavoidable to protect oneself sufficiently.</p>
<a id="S109"><h2>Not jeopardize what's been achieved</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is still with us and even if we have much lower numbers again, the measures should be preserved because loosening them too soon will always throw us back again to square one!</p>
<a id="S110"><h2>Home office great thing</h2></a>

<a id="S114"><h2>B.1.1.7 Mutation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the British mutation is highly contagious compared to the original virus. And that this means more infected people, more severe courses of disease, and more deaths!</p>
<a id="S115"><h2>B.1.351 Mutation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the South African mutation is better at tricking the human immune system. And that vaccines might be less effective, and that after surviving covid-19, you could re-infect yourself with this variant!</p>
<a id="S116"><h2>P1 Mutation</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Amazon mutation P1 is three times more contagious than the original virus. And that it is responsible for the catastrophic conditions in Manaus, Brazil!</p>
<a id="S117"><h2>Immune Escape</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that viral mutations with the E484K genetic variant are more dangerous because they evade the protective effects of the human immune system by preventing already-formed antibodies from docking.</p>

<a id="S123"><h2>Israel successful</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the vaccination campaign in Israel is a complete success, preventing both the disease and further contagions there. And that herd immunity has almost been achieved in the country.</p>
<a id="S124"><h2>AIDS also under&shy;estimated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that AIDS was also not properly assessed in its early stages. And that many additional victims had to be mourned before those affected took the risk seriously and protected themselves.</p>
<a id="S125"><h2>Measures: everyone healthier</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that drastic statistical decreases in all other respiratory diseases can only be seen as a success of the measures. Masks and social distancing are making us all healthier, and for that they have already paid off.</p>
<a id="S126"><h2>Smarter than the rest?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> if you think you're smarter than the whole rest of the world with your views on the crisis? And how you can be so sure of your facts and your conclusions?</p>

<a id="S128"><h2>Vaccine egoism real problem</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that rich countries take advantage to get enough vaccine doses faster than the rest of the world. And that this injustice is the real problem!</p>
<a id="S129"><h2>Business lobbying prolonges</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that businesses, with their lobbyists, keep interfering in politics and watering or preventing effective measures. And that we, like other countries, would have been through the crisis long ago without these interventions.</p>
<a id="S130"><h2>FLICC principle</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that Corona-critical positions are FLICC, taken only by pseudo-experts mostly unfamiliar with the subject, based on disinformation and full of logical errors. And that instead one should only follow real experts.</p>
<a id="S131"><h2>Why masks in surgeries?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i>, if masks don't help, why do surgeons wear them during their surgeries? From this fact alone one could deduce that these masks are at least partially effective against viruses.</p>
<a id="S132"><h2>Researchers are heroes</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the researchers behind the vaccine development are real heroes who deserved their awards. And that without them, we would have had many more victims to mourn and would have had to endure the pandemic for much longer.</p>
<a id="S133"><h2>Bill Gates Philanthropist</h2></a>

<a id="S134"><h2>Vaccination Little Sacrifice</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that getting vaccinated is the contribution of each and every one of us to ridding the world of the pandemic. And that the minimal risk of adverse effects associated with it is, after all, a small sacrifice compared to the chance for everyone to return to normal life.</p>
<a id="S135"><h2>Digital Vaccination Card Solution</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because we can only defeat the pandemic if as many people as possible are vaccinated, the digital vaccination card will help us as a ticket and thus motivator to get closer to that goal as quickly as possible.</p>
<a id="S136"><h2>Millions dead</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if measures like lockdowns and curfews had not been taken worldwide, we would have had millions more dead. And that the model calculations on which these predictions are based were worked out by reliable scientists.</p>
<a id="S137"><h2>Big Pharma Indispensable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as a human race wouldn't be where we are now without the huge risks the pharmaceutical industry takes in developing medical therapies. And that these companies are valued far too little.</p>
<a id="S138"><h2>Masks harmless</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing masks should not cause any health problems to healthy children and adults. And that for exceptional cases a mask exemption certificate can always be presented.</p>
<a id="S139"><h2>Virus fatal worldwide</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide, at many sites of infection, the uncontrolled spread of the virus has caused catastrophic conditions. And that the measures taken elsewhere have been precisely successful in suppressing that spread.</p>
<a id="S140"><h2>What about India?</h2></a>

<a id="S142"><h2>PCR tests reliable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the PCR test procedure is proven and has a high reliability documented by many studies. And that dubious findings are usually backed by testing additional gene sections.</p>
<a id="S143"><h2>Prevention Paradox</h2></a>
<p>They say<i>in all seriousness</i> that the success of preventive measures makes people lose their sense of danger. Moreover, since they do little for the individual, acceptance of both the measures - and for the all-important vaccination - suffers.</p>
<a id="S144"><h2>Unvaccinated will be sick</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the people who don't get vaccinated are very likely to end up with Covid, since the virus has few carriers left. And that the unvaccinated will thus be responsible for the pandemic to not end.</p>
<a id="S145"><h2>Gurgling does little</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the assumption that you can protect yourself from contracting the virus by gargling or other home remedies would be a false one. And that such medical misinformation can be life-threatening.</p>
<a id="S146"><h2>Vaccination of children unavoidable</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccinating even children is unavoidable to end the pandemic. And that it is, after all, also a question of generational justice that children also get access to the vaccines.</p>
<a id="S147"><h2>Vaccine Shedding Nonsense</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that unvaccinated people can "catch it" from vaccinated people and should therefore stay away from them is nonsense. And that it is sad if the latter for this reason begin to observe hygiene rules such as masks.</p>
<a id="S148"><h2>Vaccinating gives vitality</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that vaccination has given them back strength and vitality. And that since then, they've had a sense of lightness that feels so good, they're recommending others get vaccinated soon, too.</p>
<a id="S149"><h2>Vaccinating sets you free</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that besides the security also the freedoms that you get back after vaccination, are reason enough to get vaccinated. And that the refusers will then lead a life of deprivation.</p>
<a id="S150"><h2>Vaccinating means love</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that getting vaccinated is a matter of solidarity with one's fellow man after all. And that the prospect of overcoming the pandemic with joint effort should be enough to undergo this small intervention.</p>
<a id="S151"><h2>Indian Mutant Dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Indian mutant is causing untold suffering in the country of origin. And that this clearly shows that neither the pandemic is over, nor the risk to individuals negligible.</p>
<a id="S152"><h2>Telegram dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Russian messenger Telegram, on which criminals and Nazis have been cavorting for years, is doubly dangerous: on the one hand, it is not taken data protection serious, on the other hand, nowhere more unedited false information is spread. And that it should therefore not be used under any circumstances.</p>
<a id="S153"><h2>Vaccinated are only malingering</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many people, who announced themselves ill after their inoculation first once for days, are in part only simulators. And that it is tempting to take a few days off after vaccination.</p>
<a id="S154"><h2>Unvaccinated put others at risk</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the end everyone will have to get vaccinated so we can successfully defeat the virus. And that everyone who is re-vaccinated is a permanent threat to everyone else, which can only be countered by isolation.</p>
<a id="S155"><h2>Unvaccinated make mutations</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus can not only spread unhindered over the bodies of the unvaccinated but mutate more intensively. And that therefore every unvaccinated person increases the risk that new dangerous mutations will emerge and further prevent our return to normalcy.</p>
<a id="S156"><h2>Half-knowledge dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many critics are completely wrongly sure of their case and their arguments, since they are usually based on only half-knowledge. And that only experts really have the full knowledge that allows an assessment of many issues.</p>
<a id="S157"><h2>Politicians want re-election</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the regulation mania of politicians shooting partly beyond the goal can be explained also simply with the fact that these want to be re-elected evenly gladly. And that they hope to achieve that by creating a sense of security for the majority.</p>
<a id="S158"><h2>Chaos Theory Explains it</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all you need to explain the crisis is chaos theory, not conspiracy theories. And that, in general, the simplest explanation is always the most likely.</p>
<a id="S159"><h2>Many more dead than official</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the dark figure of corona deaths worldwide is most certainly tens of times higher than the official figures suggest. And that one can therefore also assume an umpteen-fold higher risk for all of us.</p>
<a id="S160"><h2>Travel irresponsible</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who are still traveling in the current crisis are behaving highly irresponsibly. And that every traveler carries with them a risk of carrying viruses and viral mutations into or out of other countries.</p>
<a id="S161"><h2>Refuting Bullshit Harder</h2></a>

<a id="S162"><h2>Protests increase incidence</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many people taking to the streets around the world against the Corona measures are partly to blame for our failure to overcome the pandemic. And that each new protest march without masks and distance increases the incidence again.</p>
<a id="S163"><h2>Zoonotic diseases are on the rise</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mankind operates thoughtless overexploitation of exotic animals, more jumps of pathogens (zoonoses) will occur in the future. And that this is simply a natural "lesson to think about" for us humans.</p>
<a id="S164"><h2>Will endure vaccination</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if vaccination should be problematic, they think their own immune systems are strong enough to put it away. And that the advantages, such as being able to travel again, outweigh the disadvantages after all.</p>
<a id="S165"><h2>Vaxxing for travel</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they do not want the vaccination even necessarily, but if they future otherwise not on journeys would be allowed, they this sacrifice on itself would take. After all, life is short and one should live it to the fullest.</p>
<a id="S166"><h2>Vaccinating protects the weak</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who safely refuses vaccination, even though they have a healthy and strong body, is doing so to the detriment of the weak. For even though the disease may not harm one oneself, it may harm a weaker person whom one might infect.</p>
<a id="S167"><h2>Not yet immune</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that only after the pandemic will it be possible to live tolerably with the virus. And that until then we still have to wait until the vast majority is immune to the virus.</p>
<a id="S168"><h2>Contact tracing solution</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after all the best solution for a future coexistence with the virus with as little risk as possible is consistent contact tracking. And that they therefore advocate the mandatory use of appropriate apps.</p>
<a id="S169"><h2>Information Laziness</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the critics who do not take the crisis seriously are simply too lazy to inform themselves sufficiently. And that this laziness could yet be their undoing.</p>
<a id="S170"><h2>What can be done?</h2></a>
<p>They ask<i> in all seriousness</i> that even if the critics were right in their theories about the virus, the crisis, and the vaccination, what would be gained from that knowledge? And if it really were a conspiracy of this magnitude, what could one do about it as an individual?</p>
<a id="S171"><h2>Virus natural</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is enough evidence that the virus is of natural origin and came into the world through zoonosis, the jump from an animal to a human. And that claims that it might have come from a lab in Wuhan have no basis.</p>
<a id="S172"><h2>Chinaphobia</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that claims that the virus came from a lab in Wuhan and was deliberately sent into the world by the Chinese government must first be proven. And that spreading it without proof would only fuel hostility toward China and put people at risk.</p>
<a id="S173"><h2>Testing prevents outbreaks</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that this helps the current testing strategy contain the virus, because infected people can be detected and isolated more quickly with all the testing. And that we can also accept the sacrifice of fewer unnecessarily isolated false positives in return.</p>
<a id="S174"><h2>Just money-making</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many lawyers around the world who promise to help people get their rights through lawsuits in matters such as unjust measures are just making money. And that people should think twice about investing their money in such lawsuits.</p>
<a id="S175"><h2>Supervised</h2></a>

<a id="S176"><h2>Protesting egoists</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all those, which go now without masks and distance on the road, are nevertheless only prosperity spoiled egoists. And that these should better face the reality of the pandemic and subordinate themselves, so that we all get us free life again someday.</p>
<a id="S177"><h2>I just don't believe</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that these whole stories around any bad plans of dark forces are nevertheless only speculations. And that one must always ask oneself the question about the sense. Why should they do that? What would they get out of it?</p>
<a id="S178"><h2>Explainable by profit</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that just about everything that conspiracy theorists want to explain with complicated conspiracies can also be explained simply with profit motive. Currently, for example, it is hundreds of billions in the vaccine and testing business.</p>
<a id="S179"><h2>Ockham's razor</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the principle of Occam's razor, common in science, can also be applied to the current situation: Of several possible explanations for one and the same state of affairs, the simplest theory is preferable to all others.</p>
<a id="S180"><h2>Close the gaps</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if the whole world must be vaccinated to end the pandemic, the rich countries must now scramble to finance vaccines for the poor in Africa and elsewhere. And that this is the only way to close the vaccination gaps!</p>
<a id="S181"><h2>Adverse effects show effectiveness</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the sometimes severe adverse effects that vaccinated people experience after vaccination are a sign that strong immune protection is building up. And that they are therefore an unmistakable sign that the vaccination is having its effect.</p>
<a id="S182"><h2>Vaccination is responsibility</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everyone who gets vaccinated is making an important contribution to the common good and society as a whole. And that these people can be proud of themselves for making this small sacrifice for everyone.</p>
<a id="S183"><h2>No rights for the unvaccinated</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that since the unvaccinated are shirking their social responsibilities, they shouldn't get back the freedoms that were curtailed to fight the crisis either. And that this is also a strong incentive for them to reconsider their decision.</p>
<a id="S184"><h2>Bill Gates doesn't need money</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many insinuations and conspiracy charges Bill Gates is facing all make no sense after all, because man already has so much money, he doesn't need any more.</p>
<a id="S185"><h2>All WHO claims</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the uniform Corona politics and -measure selection have world-wide their basis in defaults and recommendations of the World Health Organization WHO. And that, therefore, one cannot impute any clandestine intentions to the politicians here.</p>
<a id="S186"><h2>New start urgently needed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the Great Reset, as planned by the members of the World Economic Forum, is without alternative after all. And that a new start is urgently needed in many areas in order to preserve our living space for the future.</p>
<a id="S187"><h2>Expropriate Pharmaceutical Patents</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the real problem is that the drug companies are making billions on these vaccines developed with taxpayer money. And that the only sensible thing to do in this case would be to convert the patents into common property and stop this money-making scheme.</p>
<a id="S188"><h2>Vaccinated undesirables</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that in the U.S., vaccinated people are already being discriminated against in many states because people have been persuaded by Fake News about infectious vaccines. And that clearly shows the need to get a better handle on misinformation.</p>
<a id="S189"><h2>No Harmful Substances</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there have been enough studies of masks and test kits that have shown there are no toxins, contaminants or harmful substances. And that the safety structures here can be well relied upon.</p>
<a id="S190"><h2>mRNA also anti-cancer</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that mRNA technology is a boon to humanity that will help fight many more diseases in the near future. And that cancer is already in the works as the next use case.</p>
<a id="S191"><h2>One would have started in Africa</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, that would be the mass vaccination a measure of population control, one would have started that in Africa instead of in the industrial nations. And that this already takes away the basis of this far-fetched thesis.</p>
<a id="S192"><h2>Adverse effects easy to report</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that worldwide vaccination adverse effects have been recorded in appropriate public registries for decades. And that these allow for very straightforward reporting and therefore allow for a good estimate of the true adverse event proportion.</p>
<a id="S193"><h2>Relying on others</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anti vaxxers are egoists who rely on the willingness of the vaccinated to take a tiny risk for the greater good. And that because they refuse to vaccinate, we all have to wait longer.</p>
<a id="S194"><h2>Politicians love power</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that overly restrictive, perverse or excessive measures that politicians enact much faster than they take them back are merely a sign of their obsession with power.</p>
<a id="S195"><h2>Distributed among hospitals</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis in countries with good health care systems like Germany has caused fewer supply bottlenecks than in others, due in part to the even distribution of patients among available hospitals.</p>
<a id="S196"><h2>No basic immunity</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that there is still no basic immunity in the population against the novel virus and its many mutations. And that therefore the vaccination campaign must be carried through to the end.</p>
<a id="S197"><h2>Everything has side effects</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everything, even supposedly harmless foods and drugs, can have side effects with a certain probability. And that if you're brave enough for aspirin or chocolate, you can also get vaccinated against the virus.</p>
<a id="S198"><h2>Local outbreaks proof</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the many local outbreaks of the virus at parties, businesses or homes, for example, that have been reported in the media are proof enough of its dangerousness. And that we should always be aware of this risk.</p>
<a id="S199"><h2>Thromboses always happen</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the risk of thrombosis exists in many contexts, such as flying, birth control pills, and even by the corona disease itself. And that so far thromboses occurring after vaccinations have been rarer than in these contexts and also could not be clearly attributed to the vaccination.</p>
