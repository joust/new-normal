<h1>The Sheeps Arguments</h1>
<a name="S1"><h2>What about Bergamo?</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in Bergamo, Italy were completely overloaded in March, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a name="S2"><h2>What about New York?</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in New York were completely overburdened in April, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a name="S3"><h2>Flatten the Curve!</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that if infection rates rise, we need these measures to flatten the curve again. And that otherwise our health system will inevitably be overloaded to the detriment of all!</p>
<a name="S4"><h2>Prevent triage</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that if the health care system is overloaded, the staff will eventually be forced to prefer patients to others in triage because they can no longer treat all of them. And that this must be prevented under all circumstances!</p>
<a name="S5"><h2>Coffins stacking</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that everywhere where the virus has really broken out, the coffins have piled up near the hospitals. And that the military had to help with the transport!</p>
<a name="S6"><h2>Exponen&shy;tial!</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i>, as soon as a curve begins to rise exponentially, one must assume a continuation in exponential form. And that therefore drastic measures for containment are justified!</p>
<a name="S7"><h2>It's only a mask</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that wearing a mask according to the guidelines would be a negligible sacrifice to protect everyone. And that they cannot understand the criticism of this at all.</p>
<a name="S8"><h2>Aerosols</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the virus is transmitted via aerosols e.g. by breathing, speaking and singing, even if the person concerned does not have any visible symptoms. And that wearing masks helps to prevent these aerosols from spreading so far. <b>sheep?!</b></p>
<a name="S9"><h2>Even the young die</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that young people are also affected to a relevant extent by severe courses or even death from the virus. And that we cannot therefore rely on not belonging to the risk group.</p>
<a name="S10"><h2>Nature strikes back</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that we as human beings have to blame ourselves for the crisis, because we have thoughtlessly destroyed nature and thus our own habitat in the past. And that nature has now just struck back.</p>
<a name="S11"><h2>Corona Parties</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that when people celebrate, dance and relax together, it contributes to a dangerous spread of the virus. And that will therefore have to be avoided in the future.</p>
<a name="S12"><h2>Our planet recovers</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns are good for the planet. That air and water pollution will decrease when tourism, cruises and aviation are no longer available. And that it would therefore be nice if this could simply continue to be handled in the same way.</p>
<a name="S13"><h2>Long-term con&shy;sequences</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that after such a short time, nothing can be said about the long-term consequences of the new viral disease. And that it is therefore justified that people continue to be as careful as possible and follow the decreed measures.</p>
<a name="S14"><h2>We still know so little</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that because one knows too little about the virus and its dangerousness after such a short time, it is justified to demand some privations from the people first.

<a name="S15"><h2>Politi&shy;cians play it safe</h2></a>

<a name="S17"><h2>Can think for myself</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that they do not need to read the alternative media from which critical minds draw their information and assessments. They can think for themselves and do not need these voices.</p>
<a name="S18"><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2></a>

<a name="S19"><h2>Sweden death rate</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that due to the higher death rate the "Swedish way", i.e. the renuncia&shy;tion of lockdowns and emergency decrees, would not be an option for the rest of the world. And that those who demand it simply want to accept more victims.</p>
<a name="S20"><h2>Trump position</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i>, when Donald Trump, as a U.S. presidential joke figure, expresses critical and erroneous views on the virus or the measures, they seriously say that one should not adopt these positions. And critics do just that!</p>
<a name="S21"><h2>Worse than the Flu</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the disease caused by the novel Corona virus is, on statistical average, worse and more deadly than the influenza. And that the worldwide state of emergency is therefore justified!</p>
<a name="S22"><h2>Not a virologist</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that virolo&shy;gists are the ones who can best assess all aspects, including social, epi&shy;demio&shy;logical and medical aspects of the current virus crisis and the measures pre&shy;scribed. And that it is therefore best to listen to them.</p>
<a name="S23"><h2>Protect others</h2></a>

<a name="S24"><h2>Listen to experts</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the experts currently heard almost everywhere in the world who advocate lock&shy;downs and emergency ordinances are the only experts to listen to. And that other views would not matter.</p>

<a name="S27"><h2>Puts everyone in danger</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that people who oppose the currently suspended democratic procedures, the lockdowns and emer&shy;gency decrees, e.g. through demons&shy;trations, are the ones who endanger all others. And that this right should best be taken away from them as well.</p>

<a name="S29"><h2>Children very contagious</h2></a>.

<p><i>They ask in all seriousness</i>, what you would do if you were in the position of the responsible politicians. Confron&shy;ted both with defense&shy;less victims in nursing homes and intensive care units, and with irre&shy;sponsible party-goers?</p>
<a name="S38"><h2>What freedoms?</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that they would not understand what freedoms the critics miss so much! And that they can be glad to be allowed to demons&shy;trate, although they don't even adhere to their conditions!</p>
<a name="S39"><h2>What basic rights?</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that they would not under&shy;stand what basic rights the critics see as restricted. There are complaints and the courts even regularly grant these complaints. And that every&shy;thing is possible and that shows that we have a real democracy!</p>
<a name="S40"><h2>Scientific consensus</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the measures and restric&shy;tions for the people that are currently being decided on worldwide have been weighed by experts. And that the majority of scien&shy;tists in the relevant areas agree with them.</p>
<a name="S41"><h2>Intensive beds full</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that if we do not strictly adhere to the guide&shy;lines from above and do without, the intensive care beds will fill up faster than we would like. And that then the measures will have to be really tightened, which nobody wants!</p>
<a name="S42"><h2>Distance yourself</h2></a>

<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that countries like Sweden, with hardly any or at least less restric&shy;tive measures that critics use for their argumen&shy;tation, are not comparable to us. And that these compa&shy;risons therefore do not help us.</p>
<a name="S44"><h2>Sweden hardly any inhabitants</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the experien&shy;ces in Sweden do not help us, because it is hardly inhabited land. And that the rest of Europe is not!</p>
<a name="S45"><h2>Question of per&shy;spective</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that someone who has dealt directly with suffering and death in the context of a virus inevitably has a completely different perspec&shy;tive than someone who has only dealt with numbers and curves. And that it is therefore better to show more humility!</p>

<a name="S59"><h2>Infection fatality rate high</h2></a>

<a name="S74"><h2>Measures too lax</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that the measures taken so far are simply not drastic enough to prevent the spread of the virus. And that unfortunately they are not being taken because too much consideration is given to different sensitivities.</p>
<a name="S75"><h2>No False Positives</h2></a>
<p><i>They say in all seriousness</i> that because there have been very few positive PCR test results in Australia and New Zealand, and for long periods of time even no positive PCR test results at all, it is reasonable to assume that the false positive rate of these tests are in general negligible.</p>
