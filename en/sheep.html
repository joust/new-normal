<h1>The<i> Sheeple</i> Arguments</h1>
<a id="S1"><h2>What about Bergamo?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in Bergamo, Italy were completely overloaded in March, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S2"><h2>What about New York?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because the hospitals in New York were completely overburdened in April, this can happen again at any time and also here! And that the measures are therefore without alternative.</p>
<a id="S3"><h2>Flatten the Curve!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if infection rates rise, we need these measures to flatten the curve again. And that otherwise our health system will inevitably be overloaded to the detriment of all!</p>
<a id="S4"><h2>Prevent triage</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if the health care system is overloaded, the staff will eventually be forced to prefer patients to others in triage because they can no longer treat all of them. And that this must be prevented under all circumstances!</p>
<a id="S5"><h2>Coffins stacking</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that everywhere where the virus has really broken out, the coffins have piled up near the hospitals. And that the military had to help with the transport!</p>
<a id="S6"><h2>Exponen&shy;tial!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, as soon as the curve of the infected begins to rise exponentially, one must assume a continuation in exponential form. And that therefore drastic measures for the containment are justified!</p>
<a id="S7"><h2>It's only a mask</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that wearing a mask according to the guidelines would be a negligible sacrifice to protect everyone. And that they cannot understand the criticism of this at all.</p>
<a id="S8"><h2>Aerosols</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the virus is transmitted via aerosols e.g. by breathing, speaking and singing, even if the person concerned does not have any symptoms. And that wearing masks helps to prevent these aerosols from spreading.</p>
<a id="S9"><h2>Even the young die</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that young people are also affected to a relevant extent by severe courses or even death from the virus. And that we cannot therefore rely on not belonging to the risk group.</p>
<a id="S10"><h2>Nature strikes back</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we as human beings are to blame for the crisis, because we have thoughtlessly destroyed nature and thus our own habitat in the past. And that nature now just strikes back.</p>
<a id="S11"><h2>Corona Parties</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that when people celebrate, dance and relax together, it contributes to a dangerous spread of the virus. And that we therefore have to avoid these things in the future.</p>
<a id="S12"><h2>Our planet recovers</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that lockdowns are good for the planet. That air and water pollution will decrease when tourism, cruises and aviation are no longer available. And that it would therefore be nice if this could simply continue to be handled in the same way.</p>
<a id="S13"><h2>Long-term con&shy;sequences</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that after such a short time, nothing can be said about the long-term consequences of the new viral disease. And that it is therefore justified that people continue to be as careful as possible and follow the decreed measures.</p>
<a id="S14"><h2>We still know so little</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because one knows too little about the virus and its dangerousness after such a short time, it is justified to demand some privations from the people first. And that only when one has sufficiently examined the virus and found it to be of little risk, one can start life up again.</p>
<a id="S15"><h2>Politi&shy;cians play it safe</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that politics can't help but decree the strictest possible measures, because it must take the safest possible route. And that it is all about the common good, to which the individual must submit.</p>
<a id="S16"><h2>Fact checker says...</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that all interjections and arguments of the critics are already refuted by the many fact checkers available on the net. And that one can rely on the science journalists authoring them.</p>
<a id="S17"><h2>Can think for myself</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they do not need to read the alternative media from which critical minds draw their information and assessments. They can think for themselves and do not need these voices.</p>
<a id="S18"><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that an overly critical attitude and, in particular, evidence that motives other than our health may be at play, all of which are conspiracy theories and should not be further investi&shy;gated.</p>
<a id="S19"><h2>Sweden death rate</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that due to the higher death rate the "Swedish way", i.e. the renuncia&shy;tion of lockdowns and emergency decrees, would not be an option for the rest of the world. And that those who demand it simply want to accept more victims.</p>
<a id="S20"><h2>Trump position</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i>, when Donald Trump, as the clown of an U.S. president, expresses critical and erroneous views on the virus or the measures, that one should not adopt any of these positions. And that having the same views as Trump always puts you on the wrong side!</p>
<a id="S21"><h2>Immunity does not last</h2></a>
<p>They say <i>in all seriousness</i> that antibodies to the Corona virus have not been detected for COVID patients shortly after their illness! And that one must therefore assume that herd immunity will not occur naturally.</p>
<a id="S22"><h2>Not a virologist</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that virolo&shy;gists are the ones who can best assess all, including social, epi&shy;demio&shy;logical and medical aspects of the current virus crisis and the measures decreed. And that it is therefore best to listen to them instead of any others.</p>
<a id="S23"><h2>Protect others</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the only viable way to overcome the current virus crisis is that we as the healthy people do protect the vulnerable and susceptible. And that self-protec&shy;tion of these groups would be out of the question or would not be enough.</p>
<a id="S24"><h2>Listen to experts</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experts currently heard almost everywhere in the world who advocate lock&shy;downs and emergency ordinances are the only experts to listen to. And that other views would not matter.</p>

<a id="S26"><h2>Real Risk group</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because they or their friends or relatives belong to the risk group being concerned is justified. And that it is therefore under&shy;stand&shy;able not to be open to arguments against the measures.</p>
<a id="S27"><h2>Puts everyone in danger</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that people who oppose the currently suspended democratic procedures, lockdowns and emer&shy;gency decrees, e.g. through demons&shy;trations, are the ones who endanger all others. And that this right should best be taken away from them as well.</p>
<a id="S28"><h2>Capitalism at it's end</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the crisis will bring neoliberal turbo-capita&shy;lism to its end and replace it with a peaceful, resource-saving and humane version of itself. And that our priva&shy;tions would thereby be worthwhile for all!</p>
<a id="S29"><h2>Children very contagious</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that children in particular are very conta&shy;gious and therefore a spread of the virus among them must be prevented. And that strong hygiene measures in schools and daycare centers and closures are justi&shy;fied for this purpose.</p>

<a id="S31"><h2>Charlatans</h2></a>

<a id="S32"><h2>Critics a Minority</h2></a>

<a id="S35"><h2>John Snow Memo&shy;randum</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that, accor&shy;ding to the John Snow Memo&shy;randum, the morta&shy;lity rate (IFR) from COVID is much higher than that of an influenza, that there are also long-lasting COVID symp&shy;toms and that it's unclear how long immunity lasts. And that there&shy;fore the measures are appro&shy;priate and reason&shy;able.</p>
<a id="S36"><h2>Numbers low THANKS to Lockdown</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that infection rates have dropped again because the lockdown was so successful. And that it is an effective tool for containment not to be criticised.</p>
<a id="S37"><h2>What would you do?</h2></a>
<p>They<i> ask in all seriousness</i>, what you would do if you were in the position of the responsible politicians. Confron&shy;ted both with defense&shy;less victims in nursing homes and intensive care units, and with irre&shy;sponsible party-goers?</p>
<a id="S38"><h2>What freedoms?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that they would not understand what freedoms the critics miss so much! And that they can be glad to be allowed to demons&shy;trate, although they don't even adhere to imposed conditions!</p>
<a id="S39"><h2>What basic rights?</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the lost basic rights are in truth only privileges, which the large remainder of the world does not have. And that the renunciation of them out of solidarity is a good thing!</p>
<a id="S40"><h2>Scientific consensus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the measures and restric&shy;tions for the people that are currently being decided on worldwide have been weighed by experts. And that the majority of scien&shy;tists in the relevant areas agree with them.</p>
<a id="S41"><h2>Intensive beds full</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if we do not strictly adhere to the guide&shy;lines from above and do without, the intensive care beds will fill up quicker than we would like. And that then the measures will have to be really tightened, which nobody wants!</p>
<a id="S42"><h2>Swedish approach failed</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the "Swedish approach" to dealing with the crisis by recommen&shy;ding volunary measures has failed. And that the back-peddalling shows that the rest of the world was right!</p>
<a id="S43"><h2>Not compar&shy;able</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that countries like Sweden, with hardly any or at least less restric&shy;tive measures that critics use for their argumen&shy;tation, are not comparable to us. And that these compa&shy;risons therefore do not help us.</p>
<a id="S44"><h2>Sweden hardly any inhabitants</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the experien&shy;ces in Sweden do not help us, because it is hardly inhabited land. And that the rest of Europe is not!</p>
<a id="S45"><h2>Question of per&shy;spective</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that someone who has dealt directly with suffering and death in the context of a virus inevitably has a completely different perspec&shy;tive than someone who has only dealt with numbers and curves. And that it is therefore better to show more humility!</p>
<a id="S46"><h2>You go to a hospital!</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if you don't want to adhere to measures you perceive as non&shy;sensical, you are contributing to the overloading of hospitals. And that you should then please go there and help out yourself - without a mask, of course!</p>
<a id="S47"><h2>Imagine your guilt</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if you feel the need to break out of the new normality, you should just realize what it would feel like to be directly responsible for the serious illness or death of someone else!</p>
<a id="S48"><h2>Know someone</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that it must be a really dangerous virus, because they know someone in their family or circle of friends who is seriously ill or has died from the virus.</p>

<a id="S50"><h2>Can't protect risk groups</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that if about a quarter of the population belongs to the risk group, it is no longer possible for them to protect themselves. And that we  therefore have to stick to the current strate&shy;gy of protecting others.</p>
<a id="S51"><h2>Signal of solidarity</h2></a>

<a id="S53"><h2>Pregnant women at risk</h2></a>

<a id="S56"><h2>Democracy works</h2></a>

<a id="S59"><h2>Infection fatality rate high</h2></a>

<a id="S62"><h2>No medication available</h2></a>

<a id="S70"><h2>Over&shy;coming the virus</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that we have to overcome the virus in order to get our normal life back. And that only a really hard and long lockdown would be necessary to accomplish this!</p>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that those among the critics and demonstrators who see a world conspiracy a la "Great Reset" behind the crisis are only using anti-Semitic clichés. And that they are exposing the Jewish population worldwide to additional hostility.</p>
<a id="S74"><h2>Measures too lax</h2></a>

<a id="S75"><h2>No False Positives</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that because there have been very few positive PCR test results in Australia and New Zealand, and for long periods of time even no positive PCR test results at all, it is reasonable to assume that the false positive rate of these tests are in general negligible.</p>
<a id="S76"><h2>Super Spreader</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that you have to be careful at all times, because a single person can trigger a new wave at any time being a <b>Super Spreader</b>. And that those who do not follow the rules are to blame if something like this happens!</p>

<a id="S80"><h2>More dange&shy;rous than flu</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the disease caused by the new Corona virus is much more likely to be fatal than the regular flu. And that therefore equating them ist a dangerous trivialization!</p>
<a id="S81"><h2>Long COVID</h2></a>

<a id="S83"><h2>No suicides</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that studies show there is no evi&shy;dence of an increase in suicides during lock&shy;downs. And that this argument is falsely made by critics.</p>
<a id="S84"><h2>Virus Mutations Dangerous</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that muta&shy;tions have since emerged that are even more conta&shy;gious and dange&shy;rous than the original virus. And that they could be a reason why we will have to live even further in a state of emer&shy;gency!</p>

<a id="S86"><h2>Treatment forfeited</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that anyone who demonstrates against the Corona measures or refuses vaccination has forfeited their right to a COVID treatment. And that this should be applied at the latest in the case of a triage situation!</p>
<a id="S87"><h2>Unre&shy;corded Cases</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that many people fall ill with Corona and also suffer long time damage without it even being recorded in any statistics. And that therefore looking at the data alone does not allow for a valid evaluation of the crisis!</p>
<a id="S88"><h2>Ireland Lockdown</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the radical lockdown in Ireland in October including a movement radius of 5 km was very effective. And that all we have to do would be to follow that pattern for a few weeks to finally overcome the virus.</p>
<a id="S89"><h2>Herd Immunity no option</h2></a>

<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that among the critics are many vacci&shy;nation opponents whose cause contra&shy;dicts all science. And that vacci&shy;nations are tried and tested medical proce&shy;dures, without which mankind would not be where it is.</p>
<a id="S93"><h2>Total incidence</h2></a>
<p>They say<i> in all seriousness</i> that the total number of infected people, especially the older ones, is a good measure of the expected burden on the health care system. And that with this information, hospitals can better prepare themselves.</p>
