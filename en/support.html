This little game has big plans: It wants to build bridges, create awareness and knowledge. It is for people who really want to deal with the arguments of the other side of the discourse. It wants to make sure that people approach each other again. It wants to be a valuable source and enable an open and well-founded exchange.
</p><p>
The contents of this game - like our reality - are in con&shy;stant flux. New argu&shy;ments are added regu&shy;larly and others become irrele&shy;vant. In addition, there are argu&shy;ments that are used worldwide (the common core) and argu&shy;ments only used and under&shy;stood locally. For keeping this up to date, your support is very welcome!
