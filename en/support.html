<h1>Support</h1>

The contents of this game - like our reality - are in con&shy;stant flux. New argu&shy;ments are added regu&shy;larly and others become irrele&shy;vant. In addition, there are argu&shy;ments that are used worldwide (the common core) and argu&shy;ments only used and under&shy;stood locally. For keeping this up to date, your support is very welcome!
