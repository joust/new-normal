<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>
The <b>New Normal Uno</b> is a variant of the turn-based Uno card game, in which a discussion is simulated. 2-10 people can participate, and both sides - idiots and sheep - are always equally represented.
</p>
<p>
There is the local game - against the computer - and the network game. The network game runs via direct P2P communication, so it does not need a running communication server (only signaling). Here, one player is the <b>host</b> and the other <b>guests</b> connecting to his game instance. The connection characteristic is the match ID, which the host must communicate to his guests (on a different channel).
</p>

<h2>Game</h2>

<p>
Both sides of the discourse always argue alternately, and several cards can be played in one turn. A turn always ends automatically with the playing of an argument or an appeal to card. The next player on the turn must then respond to this last card played. If he does not have a suitable answer, he can compensate with special cards, if he also lacks these, he must draw one or more cards from the deck until he has a suitable one.</p>

<h2>Types of cards</h2>

<h3>Argument card</h3>
<p>
An argument card represents one of many arguments from the discourse. It always belongs to a topic and to respond to it, you need a card with the same topic. Argument cards idR have a fold-out back that lists sources that support the argument. These can be referred to if interested. As an alternative to an argument card, an appeal to card can always be played.
</p>
<h3>Appeal to card</h3>
<p>
The Appeal to card represents an authority or celebrity representing that side. This can be people or institutions. It can substitute for an argument. The other side can respond to it with any argument card, i.e. change the subject if necessary, or also respond with an Appeal to card. Appeal to cards also usually have a fold-out back, on which sources are listed. These can be looked up if interested.
</p>
<h3>Research Card</h3>
<p>
The researcher card is a wild card and can be played on top of an argument or appeal to card. It provides 1-3 matching cards from its own deck. In rare cases, should the deck run out of matching cards, it may supply no cards at all. If there is an argument card, matching counter-arguments are preferred. If there are none or not enough, appeal to cards can be added. If there is an appeal to card on top of the pile, appeal to cards are delivered. If there are none or not enough, argument cards can also be added. The cards are added to your hand and can be played afterwards.
</p>
<h3>Straw man card</h3>
<p>
The straw man card is a wild card and can be played on top of an argument or appeal to card. It cancels the card played by the opponent and allows it to be replaced by another (put in the opponent's mouth as something). This is done by adding a matching card from the opponent's deck when playing one's hand. The player must then play this out and answer it with an argument or appeal to card of their own to end the turn.
</p>
<h3>Commonplace Card</h3>
<p>
The Commonplace card can be used to reply to an argument or appeal to card. It removes the constraint of having to respond precisely to an argument card and its topic. It is used to allow a change of topic. Several Commonplace cards can be played in succession, but the turn is not over until the current player has played a final argument or appeal to card.
</p>
<h3>Labeling Card</h3>
<p>
The labeling card can be used to respond to an argument or appeal to card. It removes the constraint of having to respond to that exact card and its topic. It can be used to change the topic. Several Labeling cards can be played in succession, but the turn is not over until the current player has played a final Argument or Appeal to card.
</p>
<h2>End of game</h2>
<p>
The game ends the moment a player has no more cards in his hand. He is then the winner of the discussion, having gotten rid of all his arguments. 
</p>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>
With more than 2 players, there could be (additional) cards that support cooperation or can be used to "attack" the opponent away from the arguments (below the belt?). Or existing cards could work differently.
</p>
<h3>Stay-a-bit-longer card</h3>
<p>
<p>
The stay-a-bit-longer card is a special card. which gives the following player 3 cards from the deck, forcing him to stay in the game a bit longer.
</p>
<h3>Simply No Card</h3>
<p>
The Simply No card can be played, for example, to defend against a Stay-a-bit-longer card.
